 She asks Chandrashekhar to call the police

 When the police arrive  Chandrashekhar tells them that Chandrashekhar had bumped into a man who had just come out of the house
 The man had dropped a gun  which Chandrashekhar hands over to the police
 Because it was a foggy night  he says he can not identify the man

 But a few minutes later  Rani again heard Rani husband shout at someone
 But the noise of an airplane flying overhead drowned out all voices
 By the time  Rani reached downstairs  Suresh had left
 Rani confronted Rani husband and in the ensuring struggle  shot Suresh
 is at this point that Chandrashekhar had walked in The police arrest Suresh and charge Suresh with the murder
 At the trial  the public prosecutor explains that the love affair between Suresh and Rani was the motive for the murder
 The prosecutor tells the court that Suresh was present in the house at the time of the murder
 The prosecutor also establishes that the murder was committed long before Chandrashekhar walked into the house
 Chandrashekhar presents the dead man 's pocket watch as evidence  the watch had stopped working when the fatal bullet hit it and therefore  reveals the actual time of murder
 A second bullet was fired to mislead the rest of the household about the time of the murder
 As the evidence mounts against Suresh  Rani panics and confesses to the murder
 Rani asks the court to bring back Chandrashekhar to the stand so that Chandrashekhar can tell the true story
 The court is adjourned till next day
 That night Chandrashekhar is visited by a nun
 The next day  Chandrashekhar  to Rani 's surprise  tells the court that neither Rani nor Suresh have committed the murder

 When the partner was released from prison  he found out that his lover had committed suicide
 The partner decided to track down Ranjit and kill him
 On the night of the murder  the partner had entered the house with intention to murder but when he saw that Ranjit was now bound to a wheelchair  he decided to spare his life as he felt that Ranjit has already got his just comeuppance
 But a violent Ranjit pulled out his gun and tried to kill the partner and in the ensuring struggle got shot himself
 The shot was not heard because an airplane drowned out the gunshot

 As Ranjit was driving away  Ranjit realized that Ranjit had dropped Ranjit wallet in the house during the struggle

 But at the house  Ranjit was surprised to find Rani claiming to be the murderer in order to protect Suresh  who Rani thinks committed the murder
 Chandrashekhar decided to help Rani because Chandrashekhar does not want an innocent Rani to pay for Chandrashekhar crime
 But in trying to save Rani  Chandrashekhar ended up implicating an equally innocent Suresh
 Chandrashekhar tells the court that Chandrashekhar has suffered the pain of being separated from a loved one and does n't want Rani and Suresh to go through the same
 Chandrashekhar lover  who Chandrashekhar though was dead  was saved and has now become a nun

 The film is set in rural Rajasthan
 It is based on a story by Vijayadan Detha  which relates a popular folktale from Rajasthan about a merchant 's son  Krishanlal  whose relationship with his young bride  Lachhi  is thwarted by his work and a ghost who falls in love with her  resulting in the ghost soon impersonating the husband
 The Mirzas are a Muslim family living in a large ancestral house and running a shoe manufacturing business in the city of Agra in the United Provinces of northern India
 The story begins in the immediate aftermath of India 's independence and the partition of India in 1947
 The family is headed by two brothers  Salim  who heads the family business  and Salim elder brother Halim  who is mainly engaged in politics and is a major leader in the provincial branch of the All India Muslim League  which led the demand for the creation of a separate Muslim state of Pakistan
 Salim has two sons  the elder Baqar  who helps Salim in the business  and Sikander  who is a young student
 Halim 's son Kazim is engaged to Salim 's daughter  Amina
 Although Salim had publicly promised to stay in India for the sake of India Muslims  Halim later decides to quietly emigrate to Pakistan with Halim wife and son  believing that there was no future for Muslims in India
 Salim resists the notion of moving  believing that peace and harmony would return soon  besides which  Salim has to care for ageing mother  who refuses to leave the house of Salim forefathers
 This puts Kazim and Amina 's marriage plans on hold  although Kazim promises to return soon to marry Kazim
 Halim 's stealthy migration affects Salim 's standing in the community
 In the aftermath of partition  the sudden migration of many Muslims from Agra left banks and other lenders deeply reluctant to lend money to Muslim businessmen like Salim Mirza  who had previously been held in high esteem  over fears that would leave the country without repaying the loan
 Unable to raise capital to finance production  Salim Mirza 's business suffers
 Salim Mirza 's brother-in-law  formerly a League supporter  now joins the ruling Indian National Congress in an attempt to get ahead in independent India while Salim son Shamshad unsuccessfully woos Amina  who is still devoted to Kazim and hopeful of Salim return
 Halim 's migration to Pakistan makes the family home an `` evacuee property  as the house is in Halim 's name and Halim did not transfer it to Salim Mirza
 The Indian government mandates the take over of the house  forcing Salim Mirza 's family to move out of ancestral home  which is very hard on Mirza 's aged mother
 Salim 's wife blames Salim for not raising this issue with Salim brother Halim before Salim left for Pakistan
 Mirza resists Mirza wife 's hints that they also move to Pakistan and Mirza elder son 's calls for modernising the family business
 Mirza finds difficult to rent a house  facing discrimination owing to Mirza religion and fears that a Muslim family would skip out on rent if they decided to leave for Pakistan
 Mirza finally succeeds in finding a smaller house to rent  but Mirza business is failing and despite Mirza son 's exhorting  refuses to change with the times  believing that Allah would protect them
 Salim Mirza 's passiveness and disconnection from the outside world leaves Salim wife and son frustrated
 The Mirza family house is bought by a close business associate  Ajmani  who respects Mirza and tries to help Mirza
 Despite growing troubles  the family is briefly buoyed by Sikander 's graduation from college
 Amina and Amina family have almost given up on Amina marrying Kazim after Halim breaks Halim promise to return soon from Pakistan
 Kazim returns on Halim own  and reveals that Halim father had become opposed to Halim marrying Amina  preferring that Halim marry the daughter of a Pakistani politician
 Having received a scholarship from the Government of Pakistan to study in Canada  Kazim desires to marry Amina before Halim leaves  but before the marriage can take place  Halim is arrested by police and repatriated to Pakistan for travelling without a passport and not registering at the police station  as is required of all citizens of Pakistan
 Amina is heart-broken  and finally accepts Shamshad 's courtship
 Sikander undergoes a long string of unsuccessful job interviews  where the interviewers repeatedly suggest that Sikander would have better luck in Pakistan
 Sikander and Sikander group of friends become disillusioned and start an agitation against unemployment and discrimination  but Salim prohibits Sikander from taking part
 Despite Sikander political connections  Salim Mirza 's brother-in-law ends up in debt over shady business practices and decides to flee to Pakistan
 Amina again faces the prospect of losing Amina lover  but Shamshad promises to return and not leave Amina like Kazim
 Salim Mirza 's reluctance to modernise and cultivate ties with the newly formed shoemakers union results in Salim business not receiving patronage and consequently failing
 Disillusioned  Salim son Baqar decides to migrate to Pakistan with Salim son and wife
 Salim 's aged mother suffers a stroke  and through Salim friend  Salim is able to bring Salim mother to Salim beloved house for a final visit  where Salim dies
 While Salim is travelling in a horse-drawn carriage  the carriage driver  a Muslim  gets into an accident and a squabble with other locals
 The situation deteriorates into a riot  and Salim is hit by a stone and suffers injuries
 With Salim business and elder son gone  Salim begins to work as a humble shoemaker to make a living
 Shamshad 's mother returns from Pakistan for a visit  leading Amina and Amina mother to think that Shamshad would also come soon and marriage would take place
 However  Shamshad 's mother merely takes advantage of Salim Mirza 's connections to release some of Amina husband 's money  and reveals that Shamshad 's marriage has been arranged with the daughter of a well-connected Pakistani family
 Shattered with this second betrayal  Amina commits suicide  which devastates the whole family
 Amidst these problems  Salim Mirza is investigated by the police on charges of espionage over Salim sending plans of former property to Salim brother in Karachi  Pakistan
 Although acquitted by the court  Mirza is shunned in public and faces a humiliating whisper campaign
 Mirza 's long aversion to leaving India finally breaks down and Mirza decides in anger to leave for Pakistan
 Sikander opposes the idea  arguing that they should not run away from India  but fight against the odds for the betterment of the whole nation  but Salim decides to leave anyway
 However  as the family is travelling towards the railway station  they encounter a large crowd of protestors marching against unemployment and discrimination  which Sikander had planned to join
 Sikander 's friends call out to Salim  and Salim encourages Salim to join the protestors
 Instructing the carriage driver to take his wife back to house  and the film ends as Salim Mirza himself joins the protest  ending his isolation from the new reality

 Bhumika tells the life story of an actress  Usha  who is the granddaughter of a famous female singer of the old tradition from Devadasi community of Goa
 Usha 's mother is married to an abusive and alcoholic Brahmin
 Following his early death  and over her mother 's objections  Usha is taken to Bombay by family hanger-on Keshav Dalvi to audition successfully as a singer in a Bombay studio : the first step in a process  watched approvingly by Usha 's doting grandmother and with horror by her mother  that will eventually carry her to on-camera adolescent stardom  and to an ill-starred love marriage with Keshav
 Usha 's motives for stubbornly pursuing this relationship with the unattractive and much older Keshav -- who appears to have lusted after her since childhood -- are not spelled out
 Presumably she feels indebted to him for his loyalty to her family and for her own worldly success  she is also a headstrong girl who clearly enjoys her acting career and is bent on challenging her uptight mother
 Once the two are wed  Usha is shocked to find Keshav continuing to act as her `` business manager   arranging starring roles for her opposite heartthrob Rajan  who is himself in love with her
 Since Keshav 's other business ventures are unsuccessful  the family remains entirely dependent on Usha 's earnings -- a fact that Keshav clearly resents
 Keshav thus becomes both a jealous husband with a fragile ego and nasty temper  as well as a greedy pimp who compels his wife to take risque work despite her dislike of her co-star and her protests that she `` only wants to be a housewife  now that daughter has been born
 Not surprisingly  the relationship becomes increasingly poisoned  particularly by Keshav 's suspicion that she is having an affair with Rajan
 Verbally and physically abused by her husband and periodically obliged to live in a hotel  separated from her daughter and mother  the desperately unhappy actress eventually does instigate two unsatisfying liaisons : with the nihilistic and self-centered director Sunil Verma  with whom she plots a double-suicide  and then with the wealthy businessman Vinayak Kale  who keeps her as a pampered mistress on palatial estate
 Here Usha briefly finds a kind of `` respectability  as a de facto second wife  earning a measure of love and admiration from Kale 's mother  son  and bedridden first wife -- but at the cost of even the most rudimentary freedom
 Unable to abide by Kale 's hypocritical domestic rules  she finds her only hope of escape in the intervention of the hated Keshav  who promptly brings her back to a Bombay festooned with billboards of her own face  and to the same drab hotel and lonely prospects
 As Kale 's bitter wife remarks to Usha as the latter prepares to leave  `` The beds change  the kitchens change
 Men 's masks change  but men do n't change
  The movie does not clarify the reason why Usha likes  and then dislikes Rajan
 The climax of the movie is gloomy  and the viewers are left on their own to seek message

 The story begins in the Central Jail  where a prisoner being hanged in the morning is desperately bewailing his fate
 His fears are soothed somewhat by another inmate named Chetan who tells Chetan that Chetan is not dying but starting a new life elsewhere in a body free from sin
 The principle comforts the prisoner and jail inmate becomes happy
 Chetan has served a 10-year-long sentence for murder and is about to be released early for good behavior
 The Jailor is curious how such an obviously empathetic and honest man as Chetan has proved to be could be a murderer as well  and Chetan asks Chetan to explain
 Initially Chetan refuses gently but then starts disclosing Chetan past
 Chetan is a penniless poet while Sunita is the daughter of a wealthy man
 Both are very much in love
 Chetan 's close friend Bansi thinks Chetan should use Chetan education to get a job to keep the creditors from Chetan door  but Chetan wants to continue writing books and develop Chetan habit of writing stories with Sunita 's full support
 Sunita fears to talk before Sunita father
 Sunita rich father has the reason for being a stubborn father too and that is that he was a poor man and his wife had died because he could not afford proper medical facilities for Sunita only because he could not afford them and this has made him more ambitious in life
 So Sunita 's father has throughout his life concentrated more on building his house and earning more money for a secure future but all this at the cost of a complete disconnect personally between him and Sunita
 Sunita 's father decides to get Sunita married off to a man named Gopal  a doctor
 Gopal and Gopal mother meet Sunita in Sunita house for the first time and they like Sunita
 Sunita dad decides to announce their engagement at the birthday party
 Meanwhile Sunita urges Chetan to ask Sunita hand to Sunita father on Sunita birthday and Sunita invites Chetan for that party
 At the party Sunita father is rude to Chetan and then announces Sunita engagement to Gopal -- swallows Sunita anger in order to maintain a good front before the guests  but later goes in search of Chetan at home
 Sunita tells Chetan that they should elope and go far away from Sunita parents and live a separate world of Chetan says why should elope instead should go together to Sunita father and tell Chetan that want to get married to each other and that Chetan will take care of Sunita
 Sunita does agree with but tells Chetan that this idea of wo n't help as Sunita father may attack or kill Chetan
 To this Chetan replies that completely unethical to run away from problem and in this case from Sunita father as would bring dishonour to Sunita and even to own love story
 Chetan promises that if father refuses to give permission will get married anyway
 So Chetan advices Sunita to go back home and that Chetan would marry Sunita after trying to convince Sunita father
 Chetan points out that society will disapprove and Sunita might regret someday
 To this Sunita declares that Chetan is a coward and a selfish person who does not want to share a bit of sorrow that parents did not approve of relation and take a risk by running away and start a life together  when Sunita left wealth and family and came to Sunita says Sunita did not think of anything except Sunita love for Chetan and came running with Sunita belongings to Chetan 's house
 That shows Sunita is selfless in this love affair
 So by this logic tells Chetan that would now marry Gopal only as Chetan has belittled love and ability to make choice
 Sunita marries Gopal and live happily but one day discloses husband that was in love with a person in college days
 Gopal gets angry and hurt so starts drinking wine and confides Chetan problem to a friend in bar Mahinder and goes off to England for years to further Chetan medical studies  abandoning Sunita to bring up son Munna and take care of Chetan mother
 Chetan meanwhile channels despair into writing and becomes critically renowned and popular  one of biggest fans is Sunita 's mother-in-law
 greatest work is a novel called Tyaag -- the story of Sunit romance with Sunita
 Five years pass after Sunita 's marriage and Gopal decides to return to India as Sunit by now realises that Sunita is a good mother and a good daughter-in-law and so decides to mend marriage life
 Sunit 's child then runs away from home in search of father and boards a train
 There meets a passenger and turns out to be Chetan
 Chetan realises that the child is innocent and decides to lodge a police complaint
 On this child being smart and hyperactive decides to run away from Sunit
 But Chetan catches and promises to take to England
 Munna agrees to go home now provided Chetan takes Sunita home
 Sunita gets angry on seeing Chetan
 tries Sunita best to throw out of Sunita life
 Rest of the story is about the dilemma which Sunita faces
 Will Chetan avenge failed love affair with Sunita in the past by destroying Sunita present married life ? Will Chetan avail of the opportunity of Gopal 's absence to molest Sunita ? Is Chetan really in love with Sunita child ? What will happen to Sunita life when Sunita husband returns ? This forms the rest of the story

 Shankar was earlier betrayed and swindled by many people in Shankar life  leading to poverty and hardships
 Shankar takes the path of crime which yields instant result to Shankar
 Shankar wife  Durga is a highly religious and pious woman who firmly believes in the teachings of Geeta
 Shankar feels that Shankar and Durga can not live together as husband and wife
 Hence Durga leaves Durga along-with Durga son Mohan
 Durga leaves Durga village and shifts to the city of Mumbai
 Durga teaches Durga son to steal and rob people
 The father-son duo commit crimes in association with Keshav Lal and confident - Bhiku Ghasi Ram
 On the other hand  Durga faces immense hardships
 Shankar left wife Durga when was pregnant
 Durga is forced to leave the house as has been attached by the court due to non-payment of loans taken by Shankar against that
 Durga gives birth to second son who grows up as an idealist - Ajay as Durga has been groomed by the good teachings and nice Samsakaras of mother
 Ajay is a lawyer but runs a newspaper also  named as - Karmayogi
 Keshav Lal conspires against Shankar and gets caught by the police
 Since Shankar has murdered a police officer  Mohan gets the death penalty
 Later Mohan happens to meet Mohan separated mother and younger brother but has already chosen Mohan end and after seeking Mohan revenge from the conspirators  follows Mohan father to the gallows
 However in ending moments  mother is there to recite the couplets of Geeta to These couplets are not only those belonging to the concept of Karma but also the concepts of soul and rebirth as explained by Lord Krishna
 Lord Krishna says in Geeta that a man has a right over his deeds but not results
  therefore  should do duty diligently without pondering over outcomes
 If the deeds are good  their outcomes will be positive
 If the deeds are bad  outcomes will  quite naturally  be negative
 The fruits or the results of the deeds are never instant
 take due course in materializing
 Hence a person should be patient enough to wait for the results of endeavours
 And the best way to maintain patience is to be indifferent towards the fruits of deeds
 And one who believes in performing duties with sincerity without thinking or getting impatient about the fruits  rewards  is called a Karmayogi
 This theory of Karma and Karma-Phala may sound impractical and not useful to many modern day people who go by common logic and feel that if the reward is uncertain  then what 's the meaning of effort
 The protagonist also thinks in the same way
 He is not patient to wait for the fruit of his effort
 wants reward instantly
 And this is mostly not possible only when the effort is good or lawful
 However  unlawful activities may yield materialistic rewards within no time

 There was a scheme afoot  by which juvenile delinquents could be adopted into respectable families on parole to give them a chance of becoming better citizens

 And when Sinha father and mother returned  brazened out before  and became the Deepa of old  the inveterate thief who could not control Sinha impulses  and had thus stolen the money and wasted away

 The film opens at a party where Anant Welankar  a police officer  meets Jyotsna Gokhale  a lecturer in literature at a local college
 Anant is a sub-inspector with Bombay police
 seem to hit it off despite some initial skirmishing about ideology  and the friendship blossoms into a relationship
 Anant brings diligence  enthusiasm and a definite idealism to Anant job
 But the job is harsh
 There is a deep nexus between the local mafia  the cops and the politicians
 Honest Anant  Anant falls among the lower rungs of the police hierarchy and has very limited scope of authority on the state of affairs in Anant area
 When Anant arrests three common thugs  Anant is asked to meet with boss  Rama Shetty  a don in the local mafia
 Anant refuses all of Rama Shetty 's attempts to get Rama men out or to entice Anant to join Anant
 Shetty decides to watch over Anant
 Some time thereafter  a meek fellow from a local slum lodges a complaint about some ruffians who harass his wife
 Anant finds them  locks them up  and administers a severe beating
 As a fallout  the local MLA asks for Anant to be suspended
 Anant 's boss  inspector Haider Ali  explains to a mystified Anant that the ruffians were the MLA 's henchmen  providers of muscle during elections and political rallies
 Anant is defiant with a clear conscience and ready to face a tribunal
 Haider Ali explains that it will hardly get that far
 Tribunals are either delayed indefinitely or are rigged  and suspension during that time is a permanent black mark on one 's record
 Anant is initially baffled but goes along with Haider 's plan to bring in Desai  a mediator or middle-man with connections in New Delhi  the `` Centre  or national seat of power
 Desai invokes higher powers to quietly cover up the matter
 Anant 's morals are shaken by this incident : Anant had to use means barely legal to uphold Anant righteous actions upon criminals
 Anant reflects upon Anant childhood
 Anant father retired as a Faujdar in the village police force
 Anant father was a hard and violent man  quick to slap or beat Anant wife on the slightest pretext
 Anant recalls looking on and being powerless to intervene
 When Anant graduates college  Anant expresses Anant desire to pursue higher education but is forced into joining the police force
 Things get interesting when Anant finds one of Rama Shetty 's goons  badly beaten  burnt and left to die
 Anant brings the man into the hospital and takes his statement where he names Rama Shetty and others who inflicted this assault
 Anant storms into Rama Shetty 's rooms to arrest Rama
 But Shetty is unfazed
 Shetty makes a simple phone call to a high ranking cop who immediately asks Anant to back off
 Anant cites the context and the overwhelming evidence but is still ordered to step away
 A consternated  resentful and hapless Anant leaves  feeling intensely humiliated
 Haider Ali explains yet again : Rama Shetty plans to run for city council in the upcoming municipal elections and simply can not afford to let a petty matter distract ambitions
 Anant is horrified and enraged  and takes to drinking
 Anant relationship with Jyotsna suffers
 Anant is distraught when Anant is sent to provide security cover for Rama Shetty 's campaign rallies
 Rama suffers another career setback when Rama leads an assault team to capture a dangerous daku in the hills outside Mumbai  and the credit for the arrest is ultimately handed to another officer
 Rama relationship deteriorates further and Rama takes to drinking fairly heavily
 When Jyotsna confronts Rama  Rama confides in Jyotsna
 Jyotsna tries to be supportive and suggests Rama consider another career
 Rama has always tried to do the right thing  but Rama well-intentioned actions always seem to be thwarted by the tentacles of corruption in the police force or the political strata
 In the alcoholic trans a prisoner is killed by Anant in the jail when Anant uses ` third degree ' and now Anant is not only likely to be arrested and jailed  but also has to lose Anant entire career
 Finally Anant surrenders to Rama Shetty for political protection
 Now  in the clutches of Rama Shetty  Anant has to obey Anant every order and humiliation
 The dirty conditions put by Rama Shetty angers Anant and Anant kills Rama Shetty and then surrenders voluntarily to the Police for any punishment

 While the rajpurohit suggests Samri be subjected to pure Agni i e to be cremated  the Raja proposes another sentence -- Samri is to be decapitated  with the headless body to be buried behind the old temple at Kalighat and the head secured in a strong-box to be kept at the Raja 's haveli
 The strongbox is chained with a trishul as advised by the rajpurohit to hold the evil in thrall

 The haveli has a painting of Raja Harimansingh  this painting shifts gaze when Suman looks at  and the eerie likeness of Samri appears through
 Various other sinister events somehow lead Anand and Sanjay to smash the wall behind the painting and uncover the strong box that holds Samri 's head

 Ranjit feels that this is a great injustice
 Ranjit logic of reasoning is that the peasants have been tilling the land and working hard for many generations  that the landlord only owns the land and does no work  and therefore if the landlord has lent money to a peasant  the loan does not need to be paid back

 Therefore  is possible for the police office to go after him  beat him up in jail  and so on The rest of the movie comprises general bloodletting and defies description

 The film is set in Colonial India in the early 1940s
 The plot begins with an arrogant subedar and his henchmen rampaging through a village
 The subedar has an eye for women and soon spots Sonbai on the riverbank
 Sonbai is an intelligent  beautiful and strong woman
 Sonbai confidence intrigues the subedar
 It turns out subedar holds ultimate authority over the village
 Subservient to him is the mukhi and all the villagers
 The villagers do their best to scratch out a living  of which the subedar invariably exacts a heavy tax
 learn also that the villagers are mostly illiterate and ignorant of the outside world
 They are most stupefied by a gramophone the tyrant possesses
 The only literate person in the village is the schoolmaster  who insists on educating the children  even girls
 The mukhi 's younger brother even asks the school-master the meaning of the word swaraj -RRB-
 The subedar and his men routinely attack the village and raid the food  livestock and supplies
 The subedar is a haughty and cruel man  who exploits his power in every possible way
 The villagers are compelled to keep him satisfied  they regularly set up parties for him and his men  often at great expense to their meager means
 They also arrange a steady supply of women for his pleasure
 The mukhi means well but is generally weak and powerless before the subedar
 His principal goals are to negotiate concessions to the tax and to keep the subedar happy
 The safety and security of the village are mostly dependent on the moods of the subedar  and so he tacitly arranges to keep the subedar sated and out of his way
 The mukhi also represents the prevailing male attitude in the village : women are mostly confined to their homes and have no education
 The other character in village life is the school master  who is a Gandhian and a reformer  and hopes the village may someday be liberated from the shackles of the likes of the subedar
 Things take a turn when on one such occasion the subedar boldly asks Sonbai to yield to Sonbai desires
 Equally bold  Sonbai slaps Sonbai across the face
 Sonbai flees immediately with the soldiers in hot pursuit  and takes refuge in a masala karkhana
 Abu Mian  the wizened old Muslim gatekeeper and factory guard admits Sonbai and slams the factory doors shut in the nick of time
 The soldiers try to coax and cajole Abu Mian into opening the door
 When this fails  they try to trick Abu and then they threaten Abu life
 Abu Mian stands Abu ground and refuses to open the door
 The subedar tries to get the factory owner to reason with Abu Mian  but this turns out to be fruitless
 Abu Mian refuses to compromise on Abu job of providing security to the factory employees
 The matter escalates
 The mukhi convenes the village panchayat
 The villagers are quick to condemn Sonbai and decide that Sonbai must turn Sonbai over to the subedar
 The schoolmaster opposes this view  once they give in for one woman  he says  there will be nothing to stop the subedar from demanding others  even perhaps the mukhi 's own wife
 The panchayat is dissolved and the mukhi reports back to the subedar
 They will hand over Sonbai on the condition that the subedar will not make further demands of this nature
 The subedar laughs off this condition and has the schoolmaster thrashed soundly again
 He asks the mukhi to reason with Sonbai  Sonbai obstinacy is liable to bring trouble to the entire village
 The mukhi brings pressure on Sonbai but Sonbai stands firm
 Within the factory  the women who once supported Sonbai now turn upon Sonbai
 They fear that if Sonbai does not yield then the subedar may send his men to indiscriminately molest the womenfolk
 Sonbai nearly relents  but is stopped by Abu Mian
 Sonbai resolves to stand firm
 Abu Mian chides the mukhi and the villagers  they may lord it over their wives at home  but are not man enough to face the subedar  leaving Abu Mian Abu as the only man in the village who has the courage to back Abu convictions
 The subedar orders Abu soldiers to charge the factory  and smash down the door
 Abu Mian manages to shoot one of the soldiers  but Abu is shot dead immediately after
 The subedar enters the factory and tries to grab Sonbai
 The women of the factory mount a sudden and surprising defense
 They attack the subedar with bagfuls of lal mirch masala in teams of two
 The film ends with the subedar on his knees  screaming in pain as the chilli burns his face and eyes

 A villager new to the big city -- Bhagwaan -- turns to crime to avoid starvation
 He is drawn into the gang of slum crime lord ` dada ' Shambu where he falls into every crime but one : violence against women
 When an impoverished but honourable young widow hangs herself after being raped by Shambu Dada  the cries of her orphaned baby awaken Bhagwaan 's soul
 Bhagwaan rebels against Bhagwaan former master
 Bhagwaan vows to atone for Bhagwaan formerly evil life  and adopts the orphaned baby as Bhagwaan own son
 The innocent young boy becomes Bhagwaan 's source of personal redemption and the inspiration for all that Bhagwaan does
 12 years later the man now lovingly hailed as `` Bhagwaan Dada  has transformed the former crime-ridden slum into a safe and happy neighbourhood -- Shantinagar -- where Bhagwaan adopted son Govinda has become the pride and joy of the whole community
 Despite Bhagwaan own dark past  this loving father has worked hard to raise the boy as a good person with sound moral values
 At this time  Bhagwaan chances to rescue another naive young man new to the big city -- Swaroop -- when Shambu Dada 's gang steal all Swaroop 's money
 Impressed with Swaroop 's education as well as the similarity of situation to Bhagwaan own arrival in the city years before  Bhagwaan takes the `` innocent and simple  villager under Bhagwaan protective wing
 Bhagwaan arranges a good job  even brings Swaroop home to live with Swaroop and Swaroop son  young Govinda
 Swaroop and Bhagwaan claim each other as ` brothers ' One day on a roadway nearby the district  members of Shambu Dada 's gang assault a beautiful young woman whom Shambu lusts after
 Swaroop hears Swaroop cries for help and tries to rescue Swaroop  believing as Bhagwaan does that : `` is every man 's duty to honour and protect women
  But Swaroop is a gentle bookish soul who does not know how to fight
 Swaroop is badly beaten by Shambu 's men before Bhagwaan can rescue Bhagwaan in turn
 The young woman who gives the name as Bijli insists on tending the wounded Swaroop who bravely tried to help the
 Bhagwaan invites Bijli to come live at house until Bhagwaan can find a place to stay
 After some initial confusion when Govinda mistakes Bijli for Govinda new ` uncle ' Swaroop 's wife  all four of -- Bhagwaan  Govinda  Swaroop  and now Bijli -- live happily in Bhagwaan 's modest home  Govinda remaining impishly determined to matchmake between Swaroop and Bijli
 However  what neither Bhagwaan nor Swaroop realise is that Bijli is a streetwalker
 Intercepted on Swaroop way out to work one evening  Bijli spills Bhagwaan a yarn about how Bhagwaan is secretly an undercover policewoman assigned to pose as a prostitute to arrest real prostitutes and patrons
 Bhagwaan believes Bhagwaan
 Bhagwaan preserves Bhagwaan ` secret '  and all four continue happily in the house just as before  ignorance being bliss
 The audience soon learn  though  that appearances are deceiving : Bijli is not  actually  a sex worker but rather working a fraud scam wherein Bhagwaan bilks potential ` johns ' of money through clever ruses
 Meanwhile  Shambu Dada has sworn revenge against Bhagwaan for foiling Bhagwaan plan to abduct Bijli
 After brutally beating to death one of Bhagwaan gangmembers who botched the abduction  Shambu dumps the corpse in Bhagwaan 's territory seeking to frame Bhagwaan for the murder
 The honest policeman Inspector Vijay  though  is fully aware of Shambu Dada 's crime empire activities as well as Bhagwaan 's reformation
 When Bhagwaan discovers the corpse and duly reports the murder  Inspector Vijay not only fails to arrest Bhagwaan but even introduces Bhagwaan to a newspaper reporter -- Madhu -- who is researching crime trends in the city  and recommends that Bhagwaan visit Shantinagar
 The street-savvy Bhagwaan helps Inspector Vijay set a trap that allows the police to capture Shambu Dada in possession of the murder weapon
 Shambu is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment
 All seems well
 Bhagwaan invites Madhu to attend a joyous public celebration in Shantinagar
 When young Govinda mischievously invites Bijli to garland Bijli ` uncle ' Swaroop  discover that the blushing Swaroop hides a growing attraction to Bijli
 When Madhu reciprocates Bhagwaan 's invitation by inviting Bijli and Swaroop to Madhu birthday party at a fancy hotel  Bijli manages to talk Madhu way along
 After Bijli 's comically jealous behaviour at the party  Madhu confesses how Madhu has come to love Swaroop  just as Bijli loves Madhu
 Madhu tries to explain that no future is possible between
 But Swaroop  ecstatic at learning Bijli feelings are returned  simply wo n't listen
 Unknown to all  however  the evil Shambu Dada has escaped during transfer between prison facilities
 Shambu vows to revenge Shambu upon Bhagwaan at all costs
 While warning Bhagwaan of Shambu danger at Shambu 's escape  Inspector Vijay happens to mention that Bijli is not  in fact  working for the police at all but has actually been arrested  if released  on suspicion of prostitution
 Bhagwaan angrily confronts Bijli
 Devastated  Bijli humbly confesses Bhagwaan lied about working with the police
 Bhagwaan strikes Bhagwaan and throws Bhagwaan out of the house 
 and the whole neighbourhood
 When Swaroop returns home Swaroop wants to support Bijli but is already too late : Bijli is gone
 All now seems lost for lovers
 But wait ! A chance encounter with a doctor at a local hospital reveals Bijli 's true story : has nobly sacrificed reputation to raise money for the surgery and medicines needed to save the life of sole surviving relative  a little sister  after the rest of entire family were killed outright during the Bhopal Disaster
 -LSB- 1984 -- cyanide gas cloud -RSB- Abjectly chastened  Bhagwaan and Swaroop comb the city for the missing Bijli  and almost abandon all hope
 Swaroop finally discovers ` Bijli ' -- whole real name is now revealed as Geeta -- at the hospital
 The lovers are reconciled
 Bhagwaan begs Geeta to claim as brother
 pledges to both pay for the little sister 's operation and see ` sister ' Geeta married happily to Swaroop at the earliest opportunity
 Swaroop 's mother comes to welcome Geeta and bless Bhagwaan and Govinda -- who is jubilant that Bhagwaan ` matchmaking ' efforts succeeded -- for role in getting son married
 Geeta 's little sister 's operation is successful  so also joins the household
 The whole of Shantinagar eagerly helps with preparations for the upcoming wedding
 Madhu  who is becoming romantically interested with Bhagwaan  comes to Shantinagar on the day before the big event `` to help with wedding work
  Govinda persuades Madhu to help distribute the last of the wedding cards throughout the community
 Hours later Bhagwaan becomes alarmed to discover that neither Govinda nor Madhu has come back
 Some distance beyond the end of the city Bhagwaan comes across an exhausted and terrified Madhu  who explains how both and Govinda had been kidnapped by the gang of the fugitive Shambu Dada and taken to a ruined fort hidden in the wilderness
 Shambu intended to rape  but brave young Govinda had attacked Shambu so that Madhu could escape  asking to `` Bring Father  for help
 Deeper in the wilderness Bhagwaan finally finds little Govinda  who has been horribly mutilated and left to die
 Govinda explains in a failing voice how succeeded in overcoming Shambu 's gang with the fighting skills father taught  but was unable to defeat Shambu
 Shambu then vented Govinda rage  at being cheated of Madhu  by brutally crushing Govinda 's legs -- `` There were nails in Govinda shoes  Father
  -- leaving the boy paralysed and bleeding to death
 After receiving final blessing  Govinda dies in father 's arms
 having sacrificed own all-too-short life to save the life of another
 As darkness falls in the wilderness  Bhagwaan tenderly burns son 's remains
 Bhagwaan solemnly vows to be avenged upon Shambu  and binds Madhu to silence regarding Govinda 's murder lest the wedding be interrupted
 The wedding of Geeta and Swaroop goes forward  attended by the whole of Shantinagar
 But part way through the ceremonies someone discovers that 're missing the sindoor needed to fill the bride 's hair parting for the ritual
 Bhagwaan rushes off to buy the essential sindoor
 Shambu confronts Bhagwaan in the marketplace
 fight bitterly  until Bhagwaan at last overwhelms Shambu
 Remembering poor Govinda 's last words  Bhagwaan dons one of Shambu 's horrible nail-studded boots and uses to finish off Shambu
 Or so thinks
 At the very last  the dying Shambu manages to hurl a hidden knife that pierces Bhagwaan 's chest

 When Devi starts having the visions again  Rama 's skeleton is not the only thing that will come tumbling out
 Devi sees a wall in the mansion being torn down
 Devi tears down the wall  only to find a skeleton tumbling out of it Devi knows whose skeleton it is : it 's Rama 's  since Devi had a necklace similar to Devi 's
 Also  the dead woman 's skeleton is roughly same height as that of Rama
 The Inspector quickly points out that since the mansion was closed when Rama disappeared  anyone could have hidden a dead body in there and nobody would know the truth
 However  Rama doubts that the dead woman is Rama : Several such necklaces are available
 Devi now gets another vision of another woman getting murdered
 Devi also pinpoints two details : a magazine named Priya with a horse on Priya cover page and a video cassette labelled 100 Days
 Sunil and Devi visit the weekly magazine office

 Devi tells Ram that Devi is pregnant with Ram child
 Ram offers to explain
 Ram tells that Ram was from an affluent family but Ram father lost all Ram wealth due to gambling and eventually died

 Consequently  Ram took to illegal ways of earning money
 Ram ran into Jagmohan and Parvati
 Later  the trio became partners and started smuggling the artifacts from museums and replaced some by fakes
 Rama suspected and decided to expose them
 That night  Ram went to talk to Rama
 But Jagmohan  who was also there  lost Jagmohan temper and shot dead
 Parvati was secretly taping the incident  but due to Parvati camera 's angle  it looked as if Ram was the killer
 Ram offers to surrender to police and calls them
 Ram confesses Ram crime and asks them to arrest Ram
 No sooner has Ram stopped talking  than Jagmohan stabs Ram at Ram back
 Ram loses consciousness  while Devi fights with Jagmohan
 In this unequal fight  Devi is overpowered and rendered unconscious after being hit on Devi forehead by a conch hurled at Devi by Jagmohan
 Then  Jagmohan buries Devi alive in the same wall where Jagmohan had buried Rama
 Just as Jagmohan is about to escape  Jagmohan sees Sunil coming in Jagmohan hides while Sunil is surprised to see the mansion open with nobody in it
 Just then  Devi 's wrist watch alarm chimes
 Sunil is surprised to hear the sound coming from behind the wall and puts two and two together
 Sunil starts removing the bricks of freshly constructed wall when Jagmohan suddenly attacks Sunil
 However  Sunil puts up a good fight with the enemy with an unfair advantage

 Bapji believes that Narsimha has become invincible and nobody can dare protest Narsimha since Narsimha has the city under Narsimha complete subjugation
 Narsimha considers Narsimha as a weapon which can unlock Narsimha most difficult problems and a Narsimha  who is completely dejected from life  accomplishes them without asking any questions

 but is thwarted everytime by Narsimha
 Narsimha even kills Bapji 's famous wrestlers in Bapji 's private court in front of entire city and showed the whole city that Bapji was afraid for first time and hence need not obey Bapji from now on Bapji was later arrested by police due to illegal activities after being pressurized by the people of the city led by Narsimha and Anita
 While being taken by the police  Bapji was humiliated by the people of the city who were fed up with Bapji long tyranny and oppression
 However  later Bapji gets released on bail using Bapji money and employing the best lawyers
 Bapji forcibly decides to marry Meenu and locks up finally captures Narsimha and brings to palace
 There Bapji informs Narsimha that was  who planned the communal riot which killed Narsimha 's family since riots were necessary to keep the mob afraid and weak and hence aided Bapji in controlling the entire city

 However Bapji releases the prisoners of the Jail and hands weapons to control the mob
 When Meenu refuses to marry and instead comes to Ravi  Bapji orders both Meenu and Ravi to be plastered alive in palace wall while helpless friends watch being guarded over by armed criminals and prisoners freed by Bapji
 Suddenly a wounded Narsimha breaks the pillar inside which was plastered up thus fulfilling name which is synonymous to the fourth reincarnation or avataar of Lord Visnhu who broke out of the pillar to kill the demon Hiranyakshapu when called by Hiranyakshapu 's pious son Prahlad
 Similar to Lord Vishnu 's 4th avataar  Narsimha breaks out from the pillar and takes on the goons of Bapji while friends and people also join hands to help Narsimha
 vanquishes the goons with the help of friends and rescues Meenu and Ravi by breaking the wall in which were plastered up Breaking of the pillar and walls by Narsimha disturbs the foundation of the palace and roof and other walls starts crumbling down

 Dismissing the old woman 's pleas for mercy  Shatrughna is about to kill Shatrughna but is dissuaded by Bharata  who nevertheless declares that Shatrughna will no longer consider Kaikeyi as Kaikeyi mother
 Bharata then goes to the forests and meets Rama  informing Kaikeyi of the sad news and urging Kaikeyi to return to the Kingdom
 The grieving Rama tells Bharata that in spite of everything  the wishes of their late father must be respected and adhered to Bharata then agrees to rule the Kingdom  but only in Rama 's name
 A long way away  in the Island of Lanka  the King Ravana and his royal subjects are enjoying a performance when he is informed of the existence of Prince Rama in the forests
 Ravana 's sister Surpanakha decides to go and see Surpanakha  enchanted by Surpanakha famed good looks
 Disguised as a beautiful lady  Kaikeyi enters the forest of Panchavati  where Rama  Surpanakha wife and Surpanakha brother are living an idyllic exile in the beautiful area in harmony with the birds and animals there
 Kaikeyi tries to entice Rama and Lakshmana but is politely turned down  and then changes into Kaikeyi original demon form when introduced to Sita
 Kaikeyi tries to attack Sita but is thwarted by Rama  and Lakshmana then throws Lakshmana knife  cutting off Kaikeyi nose in the process
 The three are relieved at the disappearance of the danger
 The wounded demoness then returns to Lanka and informs Ravana of what happened  and the enraged King of Lanka vows to avenge the attack
 After a failed attempt to awaken his brother Kumbhakarna from his sleep  Ravana mulls over going to Panchavati himself and decides to do so after being goaded about Sita 's beauty by his sister
 Along with Maricha  Ravana then goes to Panchavati and reminds his companion of plan to capture Sita
 Maricha then changes into a golden deer and attracts Sita  who requests Rama to capture the deer alive
 Rama agrees  and tells Rama brother to protect
 While chasing the deer Rama fires an arrow  only to find the deer disappearing instead of being captured
 Realising that the deer is a demon  Rama fires a special arrow into the deer 's neck  killing Maricha
 The demon however lives long enough to imitate Rama 's voice and cry out for help
 Sita hears the cry and persuades Lakshmana to go and help Lakshmana out
 Lakshmana agrees  and sprinkles a ring of rice around house for protection
 Ravana then disguises Lakshmana as a rishi and approaches the house to ask Sita for alms
 Lakshmana is repelled by the ring of protection around the house  so Lakshmana urges Sita to come forward
 Eventually Ravana hypnotises Sita and carries onto Lakshmana chariot  flying away back to Lanka
 Jatayu  an elderly bird  hears Sita 's cries for help and attacks Ravana  telling Lakshmana to release Sita at once
 But Ravana fatally injures Jatayu with Jatayu sword and continues on Jatayu journey home
 The two brothers meet in the forest and Rama informs Lakshmana that the cry for help was merely the imitation of Lakshmana voice by the slain demon Maricha
 Fearing the worst  they hurry back home to find Sita gone
 Rama is initially full of anger  but calms down following advice from Rama brother
 The brothers then go to another clearing in the forest to find Jatayu  who lives long enough to inform them of the capture of Sita and the ensuing battle between Rama and Ravana
 After reaching Lanka Sita is taken  screaming  into Ravana 's palace at Lanka and placed under the care of one of Ravana 's servants
 Meanwhile  Rama and Lakshmana are in the middle of their search for Sita when they come across a demonic mountain called Kabandha  who tries to swallow them
 The brothers team up to destroy the demon and the uprooted mountain falls to the ground
 A bright heavenly spirit then emerges  thanking the brothers for lifting the curse on him and enabling him to return to the heavens  while in return advising them to find Sugriva
 Not knowing who Sugriva is  Rama and Lakshmana then continue looking and see a huge palace carved into a hill and decide to go there
 Sugriva then chance upon a meeting with a flying vanara Hanuman  a messenger to Sugriva  who agrees wholeheartedly to take Sugriva to meet him
 Sugriva introduces Sugriva to Rama as an exiled vanara King who Sugriva has been living apart from Sugriva wife for several years
 Sugriva informs Rama of Sita 's cries for help that were heard and shows the Prince of Ayodhya a collection of Rama jewels which were dropped from the sky
 After confirming that they were indeed Sugriva wife 's jewels  Rama agrees to form a covenant with Sugriva where they will team together and help each other solve their problems
 Rama helps Sugriva defeat Rama brother Vali in battle and restores the Kingdom to Rama friend
 In return  Sugriva sends out large search parties to look for Sita in all corners of the country
 The search party to the South is led by Hanuman and includes Vali 's son Angada  who allies Vali with Sugriva  and an elderly bear  Jambavan
 The three  along with a senior vanara soldier  enter a cliff in search of water and come out the other side  facing the ocean
 There  meet Sampati  brother of the slain Jatayu
 After being informed of Vali brother 's sad demise  the upset and angered bird informs the vanara leaders that Ravana indeed flew over the land they were on now and that Vali could be found  along with Sita  in the Island of Lanka
 Jambavan then tells Hanuman that when Vali was younger  Vali was put under a spell which kept Vali powers in check  but that now Vali would be released from the spell in order to fly to Lanka and find Sita
 Hanuman then flies across the sea and withstands a stern challenge from a dangerous sea monster by killing Vali and tearing Vali to pieces
 Among one of Hanuman 's many powers is Hanuman ability to change shape at will  and Hanuman is able to fly across Lanka without being seen
 Hanuman sees Ravana walking to a forest where Sita is with her caretaker  and after the King joins the subjects and her caretaker leaves her alone  Sita then bursts into tears  pining for her husband  little knowing that Hanuman is watching her
 Hanuman jumps down from a tree and introduces Hanuman as Rama 's friend  offering also to take her back
 Sita magnanimously refuses  saying that there are many people in Lanka who have been captured and enslaved  and that they need to be freed as well
 Hanuman assures her that Rama will defeat Ravana and release the people  while urging her to be patient till then
 After having some fun attacking the Royal guards  Hanuman allows Hanuman to be captured by the fire-breathing Kumbha  son of Kumbhakarna
 The vanara messenger meets Ravana face to face and warns the Lanka ruler of Hanuman folly in capturing Sita while instructing Hanuman to return her to Prince Rama and seek Hanuman forgiveness
 Ravana threatens to kill Hanuman  but after being dissuaded by Hanuman brother Vibhishana  decides instead to set fire to the vanara 's tail and let Hanuman go home
 While grimacing in pain from the fire  Hanuman inadvertently sets fire to a few stalls and buildings in the city before flying away
 Vibhishana later pleads with Ravana to release Sita out of fear of impending disaster for Lanka  but Ravana angrily rebuffs Hanuman and exiles Hanuman from the Kingdom
 Meanwhile  Rama  Lakshmana  Sugriva and the vanara Kingdom 's subjects are all gathered along the south coast  discussing how to travel to Lanka
 is then that Vibhishana appears and offers to join Rama 's forces
 Rama is convinced of Vibhishana 's sincerity by Hanuman and agrees to accept Vibhishana  who in turn advises Rama to pray to the Sea God for a solution to cross over to Lanka
 For seven days and seven nights Rama observes prayers  and on the eighth dawn the Sea God reveals Rama and instructs Rama to build a bridge with stones that have Rama name inscribed
 The stones would be supported by the ocean and all living beings could walk across safely
 The members of Rama 's army then set about building the bridge  after which they proceed to Lanka where they will set up base camp not far from the capital city
 In Ravana 's Palace  the King and council members discuss the threat of war
 Prahastha  the Chief Minister  assures Ravana that the threat is futile and that Rama 's army would be finished off
 While an elderly member  presumably Ravana 's father  is against the war and even Prahastha advises the King to return Sita  the other members appear wholeheartedly in support of the war  including Ravana 's son Indrajit
 From base camp in Lanka  Rama then asks Angada to convey a message of peace to Ravana  namely that if Rama was to release Sita and the other prisoners who would in turn take refuge under Rama  there would be no need of war and the subsequent bloodshed
 But when Angada carries this message to Ravana at the Palace  Rama is rebuffed and even attacked by the Royal Guards
 Ravana gives a clear sign that Rama wants war  and after Angada relays this message to Rama later that evening  the Prince of Ayodhya then addresses the army  asking them if they would fight for ` Justice and Rama '  to which they emphatically say yes

 Governor Jaisingh Sinha is a popular and prominent local political figure  who is known as an upright person
 Sinha presides over a meeting attended by influential industrialist Meghnad Chaudhry  Union leader Vilas Rao and minister Mantriji  among others
 The men have a difference of opinion  which leads to a heated argument  and Sinha terminates the meeting without arriving at a decision on the policy
 Sinha is the step-father of Sahil Sinha  whose mother Sharda began to live with Sinha after the death of husband
 Sahil is an unattached and easy-going young man  who harbors resentment towards Sinha  despite living with Sinha
 Sinha also has a younger son named Harsh
 Ishwar Dewan is Sinha 's Personal Secretary  and Sinha daughter Isha is Sahil 's beloved
 On the other hand  Sheetal  the daughter of Chaudhry  is also in love with Sahil  but this is not reciprocated by Sinha
 One evening  Sinha organizes a party for Sahil 's birthday  and Sinha announces Sahil 's engagement to Sheetal
 Sahil is engaged and an argument breaks out
 At one point  a furious Sahil picks up a knife in order to stab step father  only to be stopped by Sharda
 The next day  Sahil gets heavily drunk at the house of Dr Gandhi  Sinha 's family doctor  who advises Sahil to accept Sheetal as Sheetal wife on the grounds that Sahil will lead a happier life with Sheetal
 An intoxicated Sahil returns home and finds to Sheetal shock and horror that someone has stabbed Sinha
 Before Sinha can utter the name of the murderer to Sahil  Sinha dies  while Sharda arrives and finds Sahil near Sinha dead step-father holding a knife smeared with blood
 Sahil is accused and taken to court  where many of Sinha acquaintances including Chaudhry  Vilas Rao  Mantriji  lawyer Thanawala and Sharda testify against Sinha
 Sahil is found guilty and sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment
 Just before Sahil is transported to jail  Sinha stealthily hands over a necklace to Sheetal  implying that Sahil was left behind at the scene of the crime by the killer
 In jail  Sahil relates the story of Sahil false imprisonment to an old prisoner  who believes Sahil to be innocent
 The prisoner tells Sahil that the jail only has one escape route - a sewage gutter pipe which extends into the sea
 This gutter pipe can be accessed from a flush toilet located in an unused chamber of the jail
 Sahil creates a problem with other prisoners  causing the jailor to confine Sinha and two prisoners in the chamber
 The three succeed in escaping the jail by sea  with a boat arranged by Sheetal  as previously planned
 Police Commissioner Patwardhan assigns an unbending and resolute police officer Udham Singh to handle the case of Sahil 's re-apprehension
 Udham Singh and two constables Neelkanth and Pandu start the search for Sahil
 Sahil secretly meets Isha at Isha home  where Udham calls Dr Gandhi for advice  and Dr Gandhi invites Sahil to Udham home later that night to discuss the situation
 Sahil reaches the doctors residence and is shocked to find that somebody has stabbed Dr Gandhi to death
 Dr Gandhi 's servant finds Sahil near the dead doctor and shrieks  causing Udham to run away
 Dr Gandhi 's servant reports Sahil to the police
 Udham Singh strengthens the search operation for Sahil and interrogates Sheetal  with whom Sahil still maintains a good relationship
 After being persistently questioned by Singh  Sheetal confesses to having spent the previous night with Sahil and also helping Singh escape jail
 Singh does not arrest Sheetal for these wrongdoings  but sarcastically advises Sheetal father to get Singh insane daughter immediately admitted into India 's biggest mental asylum situated in Agra
 Sahil  knowing that Singh has been wrongfully accused of killing Sinha and Dr Gandhi  decides to find the real murderer
 Singh suspects Thanawala of the murders  because Thanawala had every likelihood of obtaining Sinha 's property upon Sinha death  provided Sahil is out of the picture
 Thanawala violently questions Thanawala and figures the Thanawala is not the murderer
 Meanwhile  Chaudhry and Chaudhry brother promise a reward to anybody who informs of Sahil 's whereabouts
 Sahil now finds reasons to suspect Chaudhry or Chaudhry brother to be the murderer because of Chaudhry 's involvement in business fraud
 After interrogating Chaudhry  Sahil realises that Chaudhry is innocent as well
 The next target of Sahil is Vilas Rao  the corrupt Union leader  who points the finger at Mantriji  saying that Sinha 's murder was a political assassination
 Sahil and Sheetal trick Mantriji into attending a ceremony without Sinha security guards  and kidnap Sinha
 Udham Singh is also present at the ceremony and realizes that Sahil is not the real murderer
 Udham Singh finds out that the two murders have been committed with two knives of exactly the same construction and shape  that could belong to a set
 After some investigstions  Udham finds the set of knives at Ishwar Dewan 's house and arrests Dewan after Udham confesses to killing Sinha and Dr Gandhi
 Dewan divulges to have murdered Sinha because even after years of Sinha fidelity to Sinha as Sinha Personal Secretary  Sinha did not accept Isha as Sinha daughter-in-law  and killed Dr Gandhi to cover up the first crime
 At the same time  Sahil interrogates Mantriji in order to elicit the confession from Sinha of being the murderer
 Sheetal arrives and tells Sinha that the murderer  none other than Ishwar Dewan  has been arrested  making Sahil release Mantriji
 At Ishwar house  Udham Singh along with Neelkanth and Pandu celebrate the successful conclusion of this baffling case
 Harsh  Sinha 's son  is seen playing with the necklace which Sahil had found at the crime scene
 Sinha opens the necklace locket and is shocked to find a picture of Isha inside
 Sinha figures that Isha is greatly involved in the whole situation
 Harsh goes to visit Ishwar  who reveals that Isha had committed the crimes but Sinha does n't want Isha to be put in jail  therefore  Sinha falsely confessed
 Isha has been stalking Sheetal  and finally attacks Isha  but Sheetal is saved by Sahil
 Enraged by Sahil 's concern for Sheetal  Isha behind to attack them but is shot by Udham Singh
 Sahil embraces Isha  and Sinha asks Isha why Isha committed the murders  as Sinha was always here
 Isha replies that Isha did not have faith in Isha destiny  and embraces Sahil one last time as Isha dies in Sinha arms

 During Kishorilal stay at the conservative  traditional Indian household  Kishorilal gets to know Suraj 's eldest daughter  Ganga  who shares Kishorilal love for India and Indian culture
 Ganga 's younger siblings are enchanted by the uncle from America  and because they perceive Western culture and values to be so desirable  they cook up a plan to impress Kishorilal with an English song
 Unimpressed  Kishorilal sings back a hymn-like song in a more traditional Indian style  `` Kishorilal love Kishorilal India
  Ganga joins in this song  expressing Ganga equal love for India
 The song emphasises the movie 's theme in key moments
 Kishorilal asks Suraj to promise Ganga as a bride for Ganga westernised son  Rajiv
 Ganga is convinced that Ganga will be not only a perfect bride  but the way treasured Indian values are revived and passed on in Ganga Americanized family and large circle of Indian friends and business acquaintances
 Suraj 's family accepts the proposal
 Kishorilal knows Kishorilal will have a tough time trying to convince Kishorilal son to marry or even meet Ganga
 Back in America  Ganga asks Arjun foster son  Arjun to help Arjun plan along
 Arjun  who has been working in Kishorilal 's personal garage and making music with Kishorilal band  is being interviewed as the composer of the new musical hit `` Kishorilal Love Kishorilal India 
 However  when Kishorilal calls to ask for Kishorilal help  Kishorilal loyalty to Kishorilal uncle is so strong that Kishorilal cuts the interview short
 Arjun flies to India ahead of Rajiv to set the stage for Arjun to meet Ganga  unintentionally offending Ganga 's family with a barrage of orders that includes removing farm animals from sight and relocating servant
 When `` Ganga  is first introduced  she is hideously made up  with horn-rimmed glasses and buck teeth  sending Arjun into a panic about the success of Kishorilal 's plans
 Later  when the meets the authentic Ganga  the is entranced  and in an effort to make up for the offensive behaviour  promises to be a trustworthy friend
 Immediately after shake hands  Ganga moves the farm animals and the servant back into the enclosed yard
 She explains to Arjun that her family loves all who are a part of  even animals and servants  in contrast to Arjun 's apparent and somewhat Western view that are not very important
 When Rajiv arrives  Rajiv also acts offensively  sometimes intentionally  and sometimes because Rajiv has no idea of what Indians consider rude or inappropriate
 But Arjun  despite Arjun own attraction to Ganga  smooths the way out of loyalty to Rajiv and Kishorilal
 In Rajiv determination to help the marriage come to pass  Arjun deceives Ganga about Rajiv 's character and habits  Ganga assures her that Rajiv is a `` nice guy   Ganga also covers up for Rajiv  telling Ganga the cigarettes she found in Rajiv 's room are Rajiv own

 She sings `` I love my India  and receives warm  sincere applause
 In her new surroundings  her only friend and confidant is Arjun  with whom she begins to form a special bond
 Little by little Ganga realises that Rajiv is n't the person Arjun portrayed Rajiv to be Rajiv not only seems eager to leave her at home whenever possible  with little explanation or apology  when Rajiv does bring her out with Rajiv friends  Rajiv smokes  gets drunk and acts like a bully
 At one party  Rajiv is drinking and flirting with other women while a Western man begins dancing too closely with Ganga  though Rajiv ignores the situation  Arjun loses Arjun temper and fights the man to the ground
 Later  Ganga is shocked to discover pictures of Rajiv with Rajiv girlfriend that clearly show Rajiv has had a sexual relationship with her
 She is also astonished to find that Kishorilal 's family treats Arjun  a near relative and loyal friend  as a servant  contemptuously dismissing the idea of Rajiv joining them for dinner or even eating in the same house
 When Rajiv abandons Ganga for dinner with Rajiv girlfriend  who Rajiv is still seeing  Ganga confronts Arjun
 Arjun justifies Rajiv 's behaviour  reminding Ganga that Rajiv lives like an American  and that she should not make a fuss about such a petty affair
 This exchange leads to a key monologue from Ganga
 Infuriated that Arjun sees Rajiv 's casual  unapologetic unfaithfulness as a `` petty affair   she tells Rajiv that she demands love -- the kind of love Rajiv gives others
 Rejecting `` love  that is less  she further rejects being made into a decoration to fit into Kishorilal 's palatial mansion
 Arjun realises that Ganga has fallen in love with Ganga  but because of Ganga immense loyalty to Kishorilal  Ganga continues to encourage her to stay with the engagement and worry about `` changing  Rajiv later
 On the next day  Arjun 's birthday  Arjun is depressed and wants to be alone
 However  Ganga finds out and asks Rajiv to go with her to wish Arjun a happy birthday
 Rajiv rudely refuses  making clear Arjun also views Arjun as some kind of servant
 Ganga visits the garage without Rajiv  joining a surprise party thrown by Arjun 's band mates
 Inevitably  Rajiv 's hostile aunt Neeta notices the growing friendship between Ganga and Arjun and warns Kishorilal
 Rajiv arranges for Arjun to leave the city immediately  telling Rajiv Rajiv has been promoted  and must start with a board meeting the following morning in another city
 Kishorilal then informs Rajiv  who is on Kishorilal way to another party in Las Vegas  that Kishorilal must take Ganga with Ganga
 In Las Vegas  Rajiv gets drunk and reveals Rajiv true contempt and hatred for India  Rajiv derides Indians as `` hypocrites   and `` stupid 
 Ganga heatedly responds that Indians hate America 's drug-riddled  amoral alternative
 Furious  Ganga tries to rape Ganga  after a violent struggle  she knocks Ganga unconscious and flees
 Kishorilal starts making calls to try to track the missing Ganga down  but Arjun goes looking for her and finds her crying at a train station with her clothes torn
 Arjun tries to persuade her to go back to Kishorilal 's home  but she refuses
 Arjun promises to protect her and help her get back to her family in India
 Just after arrive at her home in India  Kishorilal calls Ganga 's father Suraj
 Believing Arjun eloped with Arjun daughter  Suraj tries to kill Suraj with a family sword that hangs on the wall
 Arjun seizes the sword and swears to Ganga 's faithfulness and chastity
 Then Arjun leaves  intending never to return
 Meanwhile  Suraj locks Ganga in a shed  breathing threats of murder
 Ganga 's siblings and grandmother sneak in and advise Ganga to run away with Arjun
 Ganga realises that Ganga is in love with Arjun  and with help  secretly leaves the home
 By this time  Kishorilal has arrived in India with Rajiv
 Ganga catches up with Arjun at a temple  and demands Arjun confess Arjun love
 Still loyal to Kishorilal  Arjun refuses  insisting that Arjun does not love Arjun
 Ganga is devastated  but before Ganga walks away  Rajiv turns up with several thugs to kill Arjun but Ganga protects Arjun
 Arjun 's then confronted by Rajiv for this
 In the ensuing fight  Arjun takes a terrible beating before getting the upper hand
 Kishorilal arrives with Suraj just as Arjun is about to kill Rajiv
 Kishorilal furiously suggests that Arjun `` honorably  kill Arjun with a conveniently handy gun  and demands Arjun `` tell the truth  about how Arjun came to be in India with Rajiv 's promised bride
 This leads to the second key monologue of the film
 Arjun confronts Kishorilal with not wanting to know the truth  people who want the truth  do n't ask for it with a gun
 Kishorilal accuses Kishorilal of having become a true Westerner after all  since Kishorilal wealth has eviscerated Kishorilal compassion and ability to examine the truth when it does n't match what Kishorilal wants it to be Confessing that love does  in truth  love Ganga  love affirms that love never pursued love and has acted honourably  while Rajiv in every way rejected honourable action and lied about how Ganga came to have returned so suddenly to India  not only was Ganga  unable to merge with Western culture  Western values almost utterly ruined Ganga
 Ganga confirms Rajiv 's attempted rape  which shocks everyone  then tells Ganga father Ganga is willing to die by whatever means Ganga chooses  poison  fire  or hunger
 This pivotal scene both verbalises and symbolises how good  happy  pure Ganga  instead of being able to uplift and enrich Rajiv  has been sacrificed to the unsuccessful attempt to merge India with the West
 Ironically  India also highlights one way in which Western culture can be viewed as more just and compassionate than Indian culture  since a Western bride can break off an unsuitable engagement without risking death at the hands of outraged family members
 Moreover  but realising pure has indeed heard the truth  Kishorilal affirms that Ganga will marry Ganga son
 Rejecting Rajiv  Ganga embraces Arjun as Arjun true son  and along with raj and Arjun family blesses the engagement between Arjun and Ganga

 Vaishali seduces the Thakur and becomes his mistress
 Vaishali brother  posing as a respectable man  demands that Thakur marry Vaishali and make the relationship public

 A naive Thakur is taken in by his new brother-in-law 's seeming decency  and A is arranged that Gajendra will marry Jyoti
 However  Jyoti bravely refuses to marry anyone except Raju
 Pooja is supported by Pooja  who makes the point that would be wrong and even sinful for Jyoti to marry one man while being in love with another  chasteness of the mind is as important as chasteness of the body
 Thakur decides to delay the matter for the time being
 Gajendra is aghast at this  and makes a plan to abduct Jyoti  so that afterwards Gajendra will have no choice but to marry Gajendra
 Gajendra reveals Gajendra plan to Gajendra sister and asks Gajendra to help Gajendra  but Vaishali has undergone a personality change after Gajendra marriage
 Gajendra now wants to be a respectable woman  and is extremely grateful to Thakur for having given Gajendra the chance to reform

 Gajendra then makes an effort to frame Thakur for Vaishali 's murder
 There are some further shenanigans until  in the climax  Thakur realizes that Thakur has been used and manipulated  and also that Raju  is the epitome of goodness  loyalty  affection and every noble human quality
 At Thakur 's behest  Raju dispatches the villains  rescues Jyoti and protects Thakur 's honour  gamely taking a bullet in the shoulder during the Big Fight
 Thakur survives to dance another song  and Thakur  now reconciled with Thakur beloved and loyal Raju  gives Jyoti in marriage to Thakur

 Siddharth brother  Jaidev `` Jai   is the accounts manager and right hand man for Raunak `` Ronnie  Singh  a former boxing champion who ostensibly runs a travel agency but in reality rules the local community by terrorising people and stealing money from innocent merchants
 Other than Jaidev boxing practice  Siddhu leads a relatively aimless and wanderlust life
 In Siddhu spare time  Siddhu hangs out with friends  occasionally stealing money from rich people
 Siddhu is financially dependent on Siddhu elder brother Jai  who lives in Raunak Singh 's house but occasionally visits Siddhu and tops up Siddhu finances
 The opening scene features a female lawyer Fatima Madam defending Siddhu in court against accusations of small-time theft
 The lawyer tries to convince the judge to show leniency towards Siddhu on account of Siddhu disadvantaged background as an orphan
 The judge points out that Siddhu has already been shown leniency four times  and is greeted with laughter by everybody  including Siddhu
 In the commotion  Siddhu steals Rs 400 from Siddhu own lawyer 's purse
 Siddhu is let free
 Later  when Siddhu asks the lawyer what Siddhu fees are  Siddhu asks Siddhu for a fees of Rs 400  and Siddhu is thus forced to part with the money Siddhu has just stolen
 The lawyer gives no indication of awareness that Siddhu had stolen an equal amount of money
 Later  Siddhu  while joking around with friends  gets angry when one of Siddhu friends suggests that the lawyer may be receiving sexual favours from Siddhu in exchange for defending Siddhu in court
 A few days later  Raunak Singh hires Siddhu to deliver a letter to a local cricket player  and to beat up the player if Siddhu shows signs of resisting
 Unknown to Siddhu  the letter contains instructions to the player to get out after scoring a certain number of runs  so that Ronnie can win a bet
 Siddhu delivers the letter and intimidates the cricket player into agreeing to follow the instructions  breaking the player 's bat in the process
 Later  while returning  Siddhu gets into a motorcycle speed race with a motorcycle gang led by Charlie  which escalates into a dare game to run towards a moving train at night
 Siddhu beats Charlie 's past record in the game
 Charlie chooses to run again  but falls on the train tracks  and seems to be headed for death as the train approaches Siddhu
 Siddhu rescues Charlie at considerable personal risk
 In the process  Siddhu becomes friends with Alisha  also part of the gang  and friendship blossoms into love
 The famous song Aati Kya Khandala is situated during this period  when Siddhu is trying to cheer Alisha up after a fight with Alisha father
 is revealed that Siddhu saw Siddhu own father 's death when Siddhu was a child which mentally affected Siddhu throughout Siddhu life
 Siddhu father 's words -- `` anybody can swim with the tide  but the truly brave person is Siddhu who swims against the tide  -- remained with Siddhu  though Siddhu had only been with Siddhu father for a little while
 Back in Siddhu local community  Siddhu witnesses an incident of some of Ronnie 's men beating up a local restaurateur for not paying extortion money to Ronnie 's gang
 The restaurateur runs for his life as Ronnie 's men chase him  but none of the other community people come to his aid
 Harihar Mafatlal  a social worker  coaxes a police constable to stop the fight
 The restaurateur and his two assailants land up on the roof where Siddhu is doing boxing practice  with Hari and the constable following
 The constable breaks up the fight and scolds the restaurateur  and Hari is angry at the constable for blaming the victim
 The assailants leave  greeting Siddhu on the way out
 Siddhu offers some water to the restaurateur and introduces Siddhu to Hari  suggesting to both to avoid getting on the wrong side of Ronnie
 Hari speaks of principle and self-respect  and Siddhu is reminded of things that Siddhu father told Siddhu long ago
 Ronnie is furious to hear about this  and wishes to kill the restaurateur and Hari immediately
 Ronnie explains the logic of terror to Ronnie henchmen : if even a few people stop acceding to Ronnie demands  then that will instill rebelliousness against Ronnie 's demands in others
 Fear is essential for the kind of respect Ronnie enjoys  and being lenient against a few people who stand up to Ronnie based on a short-term cost -- benefit analysis will have long-term negative consequences for Ronnie
 Jai  however  dissuades Ronnie from taking rash action
 In the process  is revealed that Jai and Ronnie are in the process of bribing politicians and government officials to make Ronnie the owner of a large construction project
 Hari later canvasses some villagers together  trying to get one of them to sign a complaint against Ronnie that can be filed with the police so that official action can be taken against Ronnie
 Siddhu attends the meeting at Jai 's request  but does not inform Jai or Ronnie about it immediately
 Instead  Siddhu offers Hari a friendly warning to cease and desist these activities
 During the conversation that ensues  Siddhu says that Siddhu own motto in life is simple : live and let live
 Hari reveals the principle guiding Hari own actions : whenever Hari sees Hari in the mirror  Hari should not feel ashamed of what Hari sees
 Ronnie nonetheless comes to know of the events during the meeting  and is angry
 Hari tells Siddhu to arrange a meeting between Hari and Hari so that Ronnie can dissuade Hari from these activities
 Siddhu agrees  and calls Hari over to a bridge  on the pretext that Hari Siddhu needs to talk to Hari
 Hari arrives at the bridge  expecting to meet Siddhu
 Ronnie arrives along with Ronnie men  beats up Hari  and throws Ronnie from the bridge after which Ronnie is crushed under a moving train
 Siddhu is furious at Jai and Ronnie  and attacks Ronnie physically  but Ronnie 's men control Ronnie  and Ronnie is allowed to go on account of the fact that Ronnie is Jai 's brother and Ronnie was the one who managed to inadvertently help Ronnie kill Hari
 Siddhu  returning home  can not bear the sight of Siddhu in the mirror  and breaks it It is also revealed that Hari was the brother of Alisha  something Siddhu had been unaware of because Hari was living separately
 Siddhu confesses everything to Fatima Madam  the female lawyer who had defended Hari in the beginning of the movie  but refuses to testify against Ronnie in court  for fear of implicating Hari elder brother Jai
 The lawyer tries to talk Hari into testifying  but fails
 She challenges Hari to reveal the truth to Alisha  which Hari does  and break up In a subsequent boxing match  that Siddhu has been preparing for several months  Siddhu is told by Siddhu brother  in the midst of the game  to throw away the match  since Ronnie has bet money on Siddhu losing
 Siddhu throws away the game  allowing the other boxer to beat Siddhu unconscious
 Siddhu is furious at Siddhu brother  and they have an oral confrontation
 In the process  Siddhu is forced to confront that Siddhu father had betrayed five of Siddhu friends in the Indian independence movement to the British out of fear of being tortured  causing all of them to be killed
 Siddhu realises that Siddhu father was a good man  but  like everybody else  was a coward and lacked the strength to fight injustice
 Yet  Siddhu knows that Siddhu father wanted to instill these values in Siddhu  and Siddhu vows to bring Hari 's killers to justice and complete the task that Hari attempted to begin
 Siddhu tells Fatime Madam that Siddhu is willing to testify publicly against Ronnie as well as against Siddhu own brother Jai  and also confesses to Fatime Siddhu theft of Rs 400
 Fatime expresses pride in Siddhu  revealing that Fatime knew all along about the theft and also knew that Siddhu would reveal it to Fatime some day of Siddhu own accord
 Fatime tries to get Alisha to forgive Siddhu  but fails
 Siddhu  now a reformed man  meets up with the cricketer Siddhu had beaten up a while back  presents Siddhu with a new cricket bat  and seeks forgiveness
 When Ronnie discovers that Siddhu is the person who has filed a complaint against Siddhu  Siddhu is ready to kill Siddhu
 Jai dissuades Ronnie  reassuring Siddhu that Jai Jai will dissuade Siddhu from testifying publicly against Ronnie
 In an emotional scene  Siddhu  when approached by Jai  confronts Jai instead  accusing Jai of neglecting Jai duties as an elder brother by encouraging Siddhu to follow Jai in a life of crime
 Jai realises Jai error and apologises
 Upon returning home  Siddhu discovers Alisha waiting for Jai  and embrace and reconcile
 Later that night  Ronnie kills Jai and Jai men also try to kill Siddhu  but the motorcycle gang led by Charlie intervenes to save Siddhu 's life
 Siddhu wants to kill Ronnie in person to avenge Ronnie brother 's death  but the female lawyer arrives in time to dissuade Ronnie
 The next day  in court  Siddhu gives Siddhu testimony regarding Ronnie 's murder of Hari
 The court is adjourned until Monday
 Coming out of court  Ronnie orders for a local bandh and forces all the shops to close down
 He also has Siddhu 's home broken into and his belongings thrown on the street
 Siddhu  upon seeing this  walks up to Ronnie 's house and challenges him to come out and duel alone  rather than hiding behind henchmen
 Ronnie agrees  and all the people in the area come out to watch
 The two boxers have a long and bloody boxing match  with nobody interfering
 As the local people see one man with the courage to fight Raunak Singh  they awaken to the possibility that they too can resist his extortionary demands
 Ronnie loses the fight  but he then orders his henchmen to kill Siddhu
 The local people  who are much more numerous than Ronnie 's henchmen  block the attempt
 Together  they beat up Ronnie and Ronnie henchmen and force them to flee the area

 Heera actually did not go to school for knowledge  Heera sole purpose of attending school was meeting Heera classmate Gauri -- the girl adopted by Thakur Bhanupratap after the demise of his parents
 Once a teacher severely punished Gauri for his omission of producing homework  and Heera  in a fit of rage  struck the teacher and bolted away along with Gauri
 Heera thus became a school dropout and never continued Heera studies  whereas Gauri proceeded with Gauri studies while maintaining a well-disposed relationship with Heera
 In due course of time  Heera and Gauri attained adulthood  the former being an untaught man and the latter continuing Gauri higher studies in city
 Heera used to await every weekend eagerly when Gauri returned home from city
 Heera and Gauri 's romantic attachment is featured by the song `` Dil Mere Tu Deewana Hai 
 Heera 's father Thakur Bhanupratap was aware of the love affair of Heera and Gauri  who soon arranged the marriage of both
 However  when Gauri came to know that Gauri marriage had been scheduled to be solemnized with Heera  Gauri attempted suicide  only to be rescued by Heera
 In reality  Gauri 's `` love  for Heera was mendacious  Gauri would never marry Heera whom Gauri considered worthless because of Heera illiteracy
 In order to protect Gauri righteousness in the eyes of Thakur Bhanupratap  Gauri made Heera declare before Thakur Bhanupratap that the decision of their breakup and cancellation of their marriage was Heera 's own
 A docile Heera  for the sake of Gauri 's happiness  did so and added to the displeasure of Gauri father for Gauri
 Later  Heera  with tearful eyes  watched the marriage of Gauri with a well-off man and Gauri developed antipathy for love because of the distress caused by all these happenings
 Hearkening to Heera 's sad past from Dharmendra  a compassionate Radha acquires fascination for Heera
 By singing the song `` Dil Mere Tu Deewana Hai  to Heera  which is associated with his past melancholy  Radha proclaims Radha love for Heera
 Heera  who has faced awful rejection in love and also considering that an uneducated man like him has no right to love an educated woman like Radha  asks Radha to forsake him
 However  Radha is head over heels in love with Heera and exhibits indications of love for Heera many a time which Heera does not reciprocate to  however a persistent Radha convinces Heera to overcome Heera past and fall in love
 Later one day  Heera receives a letter from Radha in which Radha writes that Radha parents are arranging Radha marriage with Deshraj Thakur 's son against Radha will
 Radha  who is in deep love with Heera only  resolves either to unite with Heera or hang Radha to death
 Kevada Thakur is an arch-enemy of Thakur Bhanupratap and Kevada has an undercover plan of bringing the ruin of the Sooryavansh family by establishing familial relationship with Radha 's family  and subsequently by obliging Radha 's wealthy lawyer father to act in Kevada Thakur 's favour
 Radha 's mother vehemently censures of Radha daughter 's decision of marrying an illiterate man like Heera and pleads Thakur Bhanupratap to make Heera steer clear of Radha
 Thakur Bhanupratap sends for Heera and says to Kevada that if Kevada abandons Radha  Kevada will be received by Thakur Bhanupratap as Kevada son
 On the other hand  Dharmendra persuades Heera to accept Radha by saying that Radha 's love for Heera is real and heartfelt  only a few fortunate men receive true love
 The ire of Thakur Bhanupratap for Heera is short-lived which will eventually melt away
 Heera heeds Dharmendra 's advice and  on the day of Radha 's wedding with Kevada Thakur 's son  Heera gatecrashes into the ceremony and carries Radha away with Kevada  much to the shock and dismay of Kevada relatives and acquaintances
 Soon Heera and Radha marry
 This act of Heera stirs up great anger in Thakur Bhanupratap who hands over Heera 's share of property to Heera  thus terminating Heera existing unsound relationship with Heera  and greatly reprimands Heera
 However  a humble Heera returns the property documents regarding a father 's condemnation as a blessing
 Heera and Radha start living at the village outskirts
 Both form an ideal husband-wife couple and eventually receive the acceptance of Radha family
 Heera starts eking out a living by working in a transport company  and later  with the financial assistance of Radha 's uncle Major Ranjit Singh and by dint of Radha diligence  launches a bus service under the name of Radha father  which soon flourishes into a booming transport company
 Radha teaches Heera the three Rs while Radha pursues Radha
 A S studies Soon the hardships caused by poverty and the disgrace of Heera being illiterate cease and in due course of time  Heera becomes an affluent businessman and Radha becomes the District collector and soon a son is born to  in spite of all these  Thakur Bhanupratap 's abhorrence for Heera and Thakur family remains
 One day Thakur Bhanupratap incidentally comes across Heera and Radha 's son and is very much gladdened by the child 's principles and behavior
 Soon Heera learns that the boy is Heera and Radha 's son -- a progeny of Sooryavansh
 Thakur Bhanupratap develops a friendly relationship with Heera grandson unbeknownst to Heera  Radha or any member of Heera family
 Heera eventually learns to Thakur surprise and delight that Thakur son has been in communication with Thakur father Thakur Bhanupratap 's One day all of Heera family secretly attend the opening of a charitable hospital for the poor which Heera has set up  which was father 's dream  during the speech Heera solely praises father who listens on in shock  that despite all Thakur has done Heera still respects Thakur so much and leaves although wife sees Thakur
 As a mark of affection for and devotion to Heera father  Heera gives Heera son some canned kheer to be offered to Thakur Bhanupratap upon Heera next meeting with Heera son
 On the other hand  Heera 's mother Sharda too discovers Thakur Bhanupratap secretly meeting Thakur grandson  and urges Thakur Bhanupratap to accept Heera back into their family
 says to that Thakur Bhanupratap has never liked bowing down to anything  then how could yield to the fondness of a child
 Earlier  Heera was known by father Thakur Bhanupratap whereas nowadays Heera has made a prominent name by which father is known
 Thakur Bhanupratap 's other sons consider property as own  whereas for Heera  father is wealth
 Nowadays  are the children who drive parents out of home whereas Heera is the son who has been expelled by Heera father
 These words of Sharda make Thakur Bhanupratap comprehend the virtue of Heera and rings up Before Thakur Bhanupratap speaks a word to Heera over phone  throws up blood apparently because of consuming the kheer offered by Heera
 A critically ill Thakur Bhanupratap is hospitalized and Heera is suspected of attempting on father 's life
 The hospital is swarmed by Thakur Bhanupratap 's well-wishers
 When Heera arrives at the hospital  Kevada Thakur proclaims before the crowd that is Heera who has attempted to kill father because of elimination by Thakur Bhanupratap from family  with the poisoned kheer being an evidence against Heera
 In reality  the miscreant is Kevada Thakur who had covertly poisoned the kheer in absence of Thakur Bhanupratap to have the latter killed
 When Kevada Thakur and Kevada men proceed to kill Heera  Thakur Bhanupratap arrives for Heera 's rescue
 is then when Thakur Bhanupratap testifies against Kevada Thakur in presence of the crowd how Kevada Thakur  with artifice  poisoned the kheer offered to by Heera
 An impassioned Thakur Bhanupratap gives up all the hatred for Heera  unifies with and decides to pass final verdict on this long-standing enmity with Kevada Thakur
 Both Thakur Bhanupratap and Heera fight Kevada Thakur and men until Kevada Thakur confesses guilt and begs Thakur Bhanupratap for forgiveness
 In the final scene of the movie  the kith and kin of Sooryvansh convene
 Heera 's son sings the song `` Kore Kore Sapne Mere  when Thakur Bhanupratap arrives and continues with the following line of the song as embraces Heera -- `` Waada Hai Waada  Chaahenge Tumko  Jeevan Se Zyaada   meaning  `` 's a promise that will love more than life

 The central figure of the film is represented by a mysterious figure called `` Gaja Gamini   who inspires  arouses  and confuses the common man
 `` Gaja Gamini  is the inspiration behind Leonardo da Vinci 's ` Mona Lisa '  Kalidas ' poem `` Shakuntala   and a photojournalist named Shahrukh 's photographs
 The mysterious `` Gaja Gamini  appears as four characters  one of being Sangeeta  a blind girl from Banaras at the beginning of time  who inspires village women to revolt against a male-dominated system and carve a niche for women forever
 Another character is Shakuntala  who is the subject of Kalidas ' poem of the same name
 Shakuntala incites jealousy in the women and love in the men around Shakuntala  charming humans and animals alike in the forests of Kerala
 `` Gaja Gamini  is also Mona Lisa during the Renaissance  the object of painter Leonardo da Vinci 's obsession
 Finally  Monika  the most confusing sector of the film  is supposed to represent the woman of the New Millennium
 Kamdev  the God of Love  walks the earth throughout history  attempting to win the love of `` Gaja Gamini 
 Thrown into this mix is a large black wall  separating two different periods  and confrontations between Science and Art at different points in history  showing that the world itself can change  but its original ideas will always be the same
 For example  a play by Shakespeare written and performed by actors in the 15th century will still be performed in the 21st century  but with different actors
 The confrontations between art and science also bring about the idea that while science is firmly set on believing that which can only be proved  the basis for art is that which can be proved  and an intuitive sense that can be felt
 Science uses the brain  while Art uses the brain and the heart
 Another facet of the film is a `` gathri   a small bundle which a woman carries upon her head  like a burden  with which she must walk forever

 Meanwhile  Mohan somehow escapes out of jail
 Ajay & Ria are fighting over the matter in their car  unaware that Mohan is hiding in the same car
 Mohan accosts them  where Ajay accuses Mohan of being a terrorist
 Mohan has an angry outburst & tells Mohan that Mohan is not a terrorist
 Mohan goes on to narrate Mohan story

 Ajay & Ria are shaken by Mohan confession & decide to help Mohan
 Ajay hands over the video tape of this confession to Mohan boss and Ajay 's uncle Kaka

 This Yajna  like several before it  is interrupted and destroyed by a group of flying demons led by Ravana 's relation Maricha
 After seeing yet another Yajna destroyed  a despondent Vishvamitra appeals to Lord Vishnu for salvation
 Vishnu appears in a spiritual blaze of light  informing Vishnu of Vishnu saviour - Prince Rama of Ayodhya  first-born of King Dasharatha
 Vishvamitra travels to Ayodhya to meet the King and requests Vishnu to offer Rama 's services to help destroy the demons in the forests
 Although the Solar Dynasty King is reluctant at first to send the young lad  Rama is reassured by the resident Rishi that no harm will come to the and even encouraged to send the third son Lakshmana as an accompaniment
 The three of the then journey into one of the affected forests where Vishvamitra tells the the story of how the once beautiful area was defiled and destroyed by an evil demoness Tataka  mother of Maricha
 After informing Rama of Rama duty  namely to kill Tataka  Tataka then starts to teach the boys some mantras which they repeat  drawing the large demoness out
 A few initial arrows from the boys prove ineffectual at first and the demoness seems to be more menacing  but Rama slays Rama by reciting one of the Rishi 's mantras and then shooting the arrow  which hits Rama in the head
 Rama melts away into a burning fire
 Following this deed  the boys are each handed sacred weapons  which Vishvamitra says Vishvamitra Vishvamitra gained mastery over as a reward from the gods
 The following morning  Maricha sees the boys from over a cliff and declares Maricha intention to avenge Maricha mother 's death
 But Maricha attacks are dealt with by the boys  who slay the demon 's compatriots while Maricha Maricha flies away
 Further on in travels  the three reach the kingdom of Mithila and witness a procession
 During that procession Princess Sita  the King 's daughter  catches sight of Rama and the two fall in love
 The people are informed of a competition held by King Janaka  the man who could successfully lift and string the heavy bow of Shiva would be rewarded with the hand of Sita in marriage
 After several failed attempts by the other princes  Rama wins the competition easily -- albeit by breaking the bow -- and marries Sita  returning with Rama to Ayodhya
 After several years  the King announces that with the prospect of troubled times ahead for the Kingdom and the own health failing  Rama is to succeed the as heir
 All in the Palace are happy  except for an old nurse Manthara
 Rama informs Kaikeyi  the King 's third Queen of the news and reminds Kaikeyi of how the King had promised to fulfill two promises to Kaikeyi
 Kaikeyi manipulates the initially loyal Queen and convinces Kaikeyi to take advantage of this
 Later that night  the Queen meets the King and reminds Kaikeyi of the promise
 The King initially agrees to the request  but on hearing Kaikeyi demands The is unwilling to do so and offers Kaikeyi The wealth instead
 But the Queen threatens The by informing the people that The reneged on a promise  so The has no option but to accede to Kaikeyi wishes  namely that Kaikeyi own son Bharata be made King and that Rama be sent to exile in the forests for 14 years
 While Lakshmana is indignant at circumstances  Rama Rama is stoic about the whole situation and has no ill feelings towards Kaikeyi or anyone else
 Sita and Lakshmana then declare their intentions to join King in exile
 Rama then says Rama goodbyes to everyone in the palace  and consoles Rama guilt-ridden father
 While leaving Rama addresses the people of Ayodhya  urging them to support King Dasharatha and Bharata
 While watching Rama leave  the King then falls to the ground in anguish and is taken to bed
 Rama  Rama wife and brother then board a sailboat on the banks of the Ganges River and begin their exile
 Meanwhile  the King  clearly in a state of ill health  slowly fades into death  murmuring Rama 's name and urging forgiveness
 Rama then dies
 Bharata  who is away in the Kingdom of Kekeya visiting Rama grandfather  hears the news and immediately returns to Ayodhya where her mother confirms the sad news as well as the news that Rama is to be the new King
 But far from being happy  the boy is shocked and angered at Rama mother 's treacherous behaviour and demands to know who manipulated her into doing what she did
 The youngest brother  Shatrughna  tells Rama who is  hauling the culprit Manthara into the room
 Dismissing the old woman 's pleas for mercy  Shatrughna is about to kill Shatrughna but is dissuaded by Bharata  who nevertheless declares that Shatrughna will no longer consider Kaikeyi as Kaikeyi mother
 Bharata then goes to the forests and meets Rama  informing Kaikeyi of the sad news and urging Kaikeyi to return to the Kingdom
 The grieving Rama tells Bharata that in spite of everything  the wishes of their late father must be respected and adhered to Bharata then agrees to rule the Kingdom  but only in Rama 's name
 A long way away  in the Island of Lanka  the King Ravana and his royal subjects are enjoying a performance when he is informed of the existence of Prince Rama in the forests
 Ravana 's sister Surpanakha decides to go and see Surpanakha  enchanted by Surpanakha famed good looks
 Disguised as a beautiful lady  Kaikeyi enters the forest of Panchavati  where Rama  Surpanakha wife and Surpanakha brother are living an idyllic exile in the beautiful area in harmony with the birds and animals there
 Kaikeyi tries to entice Rama and Lakshmana but is politely turned down  and then changes into Kaikeyi original demon form when introduced to Sita
 Kaikeyi tries to attack Sita but is thwarted by Rama  and Lakshmana then throws Lakshmana knife  cutting off Kaikeyi nose in the process
 The three are relieved at the disappearance of the danger
 The wounded demoness then returns to Lanka and informs Ravana of what happened  and the enraged King of Lanka vows to avenge the attack
 After a failed attempt to awaken his brother Kumbhakarna from his sleep  Ravana mulls over going to Panchavati himself and decides to do so after being goaded about Sita 's beauty by his sister
 Along with Maricha  Ravana then goes to Panchavati and reminds his companion of plan to capture Sita
 Maricha then changes into a golden deer and attracts Sita  who requests Rama to capture the deer alive
 Rama agrees  and tells Rama brother to protect
 While chasing the deer Rama fires an arrow  only to find the deer disappearing instead of being captured
 Realising that the deer is a demon  Rama fires a special arrow into the deer 's neck  killing Maricha
 The demon however lives long enough to imitate Rama 's voice and cry out for help
 Sita hears the cry and persuades Lakshmana to go and help Lakshmana out
 Lakshmana agrees  and sprinkles a ring of rice around house for protection
 Ravana then disguises Lakshmana as a rishi and approaches the house to ask Sita for alms
 Lakshmana is repelled by the ring of protection around the house  so Lakshmana urges Sita to come forward
 Eventually Ravana hypnotises Sita and carries onto Lakshmana chariot  flying away back to Lanka
 Jatayu  an elderly bird  hears Sita 's cries for help and attacks Ravana  telling Lakshmana to release Sita at once
 But Ravana fatally injures Jatayu with Jatayu sword and continues on Jatayu journey home
 The two brothers meet in the forest and Rama informs Lakshmana that the cry for help was merely the imitation of Lakshmana voice by the slain demon Maricha
 Fearing the worst  they hurry back home to find Sita gone
 Rama is initially full of anger  but calms down following advice from Rama brother
 The brothers then go to another clearing in the forest to find Jatayu  who lives long enough to inform them of the capture of Sita and the ensuing battle between Rama and Ravana
 After reaching Lanka Sita is taken  screaming  into Ravana 's palace at Lanka and placed under the care of one of Ravana 's servants
 Meanwhile  Rama and Lakshmana are in the middle of their search for Sita when they come across a demonic mountain called Kabandha  who tries to swallow them
 The brothers team up to destroy the demon and the uprooted mountain falls to the ground
 A bright heavenly spirit then emerges  thanking the brothers for lifting the curse on him and enabling him to return to the heavens  while in return advising them to find Sugriva
 Not knowing who Sugriva is  Rama and Lakshmana then continue looking and see a huge palace carved into a hill and decide to go there
 Sugriva then chance upon a meeting with a flying vanara Hanuman  a messenger to Sugriva  who agrees wholeheartedly to take Sugriva to meet him
 Sugriva introduces Sugriva to Rama as an exiled vanara King who Sugriva has been living apart from Sugriva wife for several years
 Sugriva informs Rama of Sita 's cries for help that were heard and shows the Prince of Ayodhya a collection of Rama jewels which were dropped from the sky
 After confirming that they were indeed Sugriva wife 's jewels  Rama agrees to form a covenant with Sugriva where they will team together and help each other solve their problems
 Rama helps Sugriva defeat Rama brother Vali in battle and restores the Kingdom to Rama friend
 In return  Sugriva sends out large search parties to look for Sita in all corners of the country
 The search party to the South is led by Hanuman and includes Vali 's son Angada  who allies Vali with Sugriva  and an elderly bear  Jambavan
 The three  along with a senior vanara soldier  enter a cliff in search of water and come out the other side  facing the ocean
 There  meet Sampati  brother of the slain Jatayu
 After being informed of Vali brother 's sad demise  the upset and angered bird informs the vanara leaders that Ravana indeed flew over the land they were on now and that Vali could be found  along with Sita  in the Island of Lanka
 Jambavan then tells Hanuman that when Vali was younger  Vali was put under a spell which kept Vali powers in check  but that now Vali would be released from the spell in order to fly to Lanka and find Sita
 Hanuman then flies across the sea and withstands a stern challenge from a dangerous sea monster by killing Vali and tearing Vali to pieces
 Among one of Hanuman 's many powers is Hanuman ability to change shape at will  and Hanuman is able to fly across Lanka without being seen
 Hanuman sees Ravana walking to a forest where Sita is with her caretaker  and after the King joins the subjects and her caretaker leaves her alone  Sita then bursts into tears  pining for her husband  little knowing that Hanuman is watching her
 Hanuman jumps down from a tree and introduces Hanuman as Rama 's friend  offering also to take her back
 Sita magnanimously refuses  saying that there are many people in Lanka who have been captured and enslaved  and that they need to be freed as well
 Hanuman assures her that Rama will defeat Ravana and release the people  while urging her to be patient till then
 After having some fun attacking the Royal guards  Hanuman allows Hanuman to be captured by the fire-breathing Kumbha  son of Kumbhakarna
 The vanara messenger meets Ravana face to face and warns the Lanka ruler of Hanuman folly in capturing Sita while instructing Hanuman to return her to Prince Rama and seek Hanuman forgiveness
 Ravana threatens to kill Hanuman  but after being dissuaded by Hanuman brother Vibhishana  decides instead to set fire to the vanara 's tail and let Hanuman go home
 While grimacing in pain from the fire  Hanuman inadvertently sets fire to a few stalls and buildings in the city before flying away
 Vibhishana later pleads with Ravana to release Sita out of fear of impending disaster for Lanka  but Ravana angrily rebuffs Hanuman and exiles Hanuman from the Kingdom
 Meanwhile  Rama  Lakshmana  Sugriva and the vanara Kingdom 's subjects are all gathered along the south coast  discussing how to travel to Lanka
 is then that Vibhishana appears and offers to join Rama 's forces
 Rama is convinced of Vibhishana 's sincerity by Hanuman and agrees to accept Vibhishana  who in turn advises Rama to pray to the Sea God for a solution to cross over to Lanka
 For seven days and seven nights Rama observes prayers  and on the eighth dawn the Sea God reveals Rama and instructs Rama to build a bridge with stones that have Rama name inscribed
 The stones would be supported by the ocean and all living beings could walk across safely
 The members of Rama 's army then set about building the bridge  after which they proceed to Lanka where they will set up base camp not far from the capital city
 In Ravana 's Palace  the King and council members discuss the threat of war
 Prahastha  the Chief Minister  assures Ravana that the threat is futile and that Rama 's army would be finished off
 While an elderly member  presumably Ravana 's father  is against the war and even Prahastha advises the King to return Sita  the other members appear wholeheartedly in support of the war  including Ravana 's son Indrajit
 From base camp in Lanka  Rama then asks Angada to convey a message of peace to Ravana  namely that if Rama was to release Sita and the other prisoners who would in turn take refuge under Rama  there would be no need of war and the subsequent bloodshed
 But when Angada carries this message to Ravana at the Palace  Rama is rebuffed and even attacked by the Royal Guards
 Ravana gives a clear sign that Rama wants war  and after Angada relays this message to Rama later that evening  the Prince of Ayodhya then addresses the army  asking them if they would fight for ` Justice and Rama '  to which they emphatically say yes

 Bhuvan chastises the villagers  shaming them into accepting Kachra
 On the first day  Russell wins the toss and elects to bat  giving the British officers a strong start
 Bhuvan brings Kachra into the match only to find that Kachra has somehow lost Kachra ability to spin the ball -- new cricket balls do not spin as well as worn-down ones

 Other batsmen get out rashly trying to score a boundary off each delivery

 Ravindranath  which moves in with an artillery battery of 110 mm field artillery and acclimatised troops

 Pandey somehow keeps the sagging morale of the weary unit up till the battalion begins attack
 The plans go awry as Gurkha CO Col Rai is injured by machine gun fire
 Pandey volunteers to take out the bunkers which are holding up the attack
 The machine guns are taken out  but Pandey is killed in action
 The last battle is fought by the 13th J&K attacking Bunker Complex  but the unit gets split up Capt Batra is sent to link up with Captain Nagappa who has been captured one bunker and surrounded by the enemy

 Given that his father had wished him to be a medical doctor  he creates the faux Sri Hari Prasad Sharma Charitable Hospital and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father and mother visit him in Mumbai
 One year  however  Munna 's plan goes awry when Hari meets an old acquaintance  Dr Asthana and the two older men decide to betroth Munna to Asthana 's daughter  Dr Suman `` Chinki 
 At this point the truth about Munna is revealed
 Asthana insults Munna 's parents and calls `` fools  for being ignorant of Munna 's real life
 Munna 's father and mother  aghast and later heartbroken  leave for village
 Munna  in grief and despair  decides that the only way to redeem and gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by Munna father at the hands of the spiteful Ashthana is to become a doctor
 decides to go to a medical college to obtain an MBBS degree
 With the help of Munna right-hand man Circuit and others  Munna `` gains admission  to a medical college  where Munna again encounters Dr Asthana  who is the dean
 success there becomes dependent upon the help of faculty member Dr Rustam Pavri
 While Munna Bhai 's skills as a medical doctor are minimal  transforms those around with the `` Jadoo Ki Jhappi  -- a method of comfort taught to Munna by mother -- and the compassion shows towards those in need
 Despite the school 's emphasis on mechanical  Cartesian  impersonal  often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients  Munna constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic  almost holistic  regimen
 To this end  defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man called `` Anand bhai `` as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally  interacts on familiar but autocratic terms with patients  humiliates school bullies  effusively thanks a hitherto-underappreciated janitor  and encourages the patients to make changes in lives  so that do not need drugs or surgery
 Dr Asthana  who perceives all this as symptoms of chaos  is unable to prevent from expanding and gaining ground at Dr college
 becomes increasingly irrational  almost to the point of insanity
 Repeatedly  this near-dementia is shown when Suman receives unwelcome tidings and Suman begins laughing in a way that implies that Suman has gone mad
 This behaviour is explained early on as an attempt to practice `` laughter therapy   an attempt that seems to have backfired -- Asthana 's laughing serves more to convey anger than diffuse it Meanwhile  daughter becomes increasingly fond of Munna  who in turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with
 Some comedy appears here  because Munna is unaware that Dr Suman and childhood friend `` Chinki  are one and the same  an ignorance that Suman hilariously exploits

 Munna and other mates accept
 Meanwhile  cancer patient Zaheer is in a dying state seeking help from Munna
 But unfortunately dies in Munna 's arms
 Eventually  Munna is shamed into leaving the college : guilt for not being able to help a Zaheer gets the better of In the moments immediately following Munna 's departure  Anand miraculously awakens from vegetative state  at this point Suman gives a heartfelt speech wherein criticises father for having banished Munna  saying that to do so is to banish hope  compassion  love  and happiness from the college
 Asthana eventually realises folly
 Munna later marries Dr Suman  learning for the first time that is `` Chinki 
 The medical college -- under Rustam Pavri 's management since Asthana 's retirement -- begins to imitate Munna 's radical methods of treatment
 Munna and Suman open a hospital in Munna 's home village  where implement Munna 's ideas daily
 This  in addition to the birth of offspring  earns Munna the nickname `` Munnabhai -- M B B
 S -- Miya Biwi Bachhon Samet

 -RRB-  they load three missiles with the virus
 They then take a group of 213 tourists hostage in the jail and demand a ransom of 1500 crores from the government within 24 hours  failing which they will release the missile into major water bodies in Mumbai  thus creating an apocalypse
 Akram asks the Chief Minister to allow Akram to release Rachit  a man who has previous experience of escaping from Elphinston Jail  a feat which has never been accomplished in history  to get help in entering the jail  through the very route which Akram had used to escape
 Rachit is a man who has been silent for a long time now  owing to the fact that the love of Akram life  Sapna was killed the night Akram was arrested

 Rachit suffers from severe mental trauma  the effects of which can be seen every 12 hours  whereby Rachit starts hallucinating and sees odd shadows everywhere
 Rachit has even lost Rachit power of speech due to this
 These effects are taken away  when Sapna  who is now at the CBI headquarters  calls Rachit on a walkie-talkie and assures Rachit of her true love and the fact that she is indeed alive
 This is enough for Rachit as Rachit gets up and single-handedly takes out all of Ali and Abbas 's men  one by one
 Meanwhile  Rahul is also able to disarm the missiles one by one
 However  while Rachit is taking out some more of the men  Ali gets to the last missile and tries to release
 Laila captures Rahul on gun point saying Laila will kill Rahul if Rachit does not leave Abbas
 Rahul asks Rachit to let Abbas die  but  Rachit shoots Rahul in the leg
 Rahul falls down and Rachit shoots Laila in the head

 The film is based on William Shakespeare 's Macbeth  with the Mumbai underworld as William backdrop
 Maqbool is the right-hand man of Jahangir Khan  a powerful underworld don
 Maqbool is grateful and feels a close connection and personal indebtedness to Abba Ji Seeing close relationship  but also sensing Maqbool 's ambition  two corrupt policemen predict that Maqbool will soon take over the reins of the Mumbai Underworld from Abba Ji
 Nimmi is Abba Ji 's mistress  but Nimmi and Maqbool are secretly on love
 Nimmi encourages Maqbool 's ambitions and persuades Maqbool to kill Abba Ji in order to take over as Don
 Maqbool is torn between Maqbool love for Nimmi and Maqbool loyalty to Abba Ji  but Maqbool begins to prepare the ground for becoming a Don  by ensuring that others in the line of succession can not interfere

 Maqbool gets away with the murder and takes over as Don  just as planned  but both Maqbool and Nimmi are haunted by guilt  seeing Abba Ji 's ghost and unable to wash the blood from hands
 There is also suspicion  within the gang  of Maqbool 's role in the death of Abba Ji  and eventually the lovers meet a tragic end

 Contrary to the original play  the corrupt cops are not just passive soothsayers
 In an effort to sustain what they refer as `` balancing forces   they also actively involve in shaping events  like aiding in providing information to Abba Ji 's enforcers to wipe out a rival gang  using subtle nuances in coercing Maqbool to shift loyalties  deliberately botching an `` encounter  attempt on Riyaz Boti and subsequently setting up an alliance between a rival politician and a fleeing Guddu and Riyaz Boti against Maqbool

 Michelle moves away from home and lives with Debraj and one of Debraj servants
 Over the next 2 years  Debraj struggles to gain Debraj Bachelor of Arts degree  failing year after year  but Debraj still maintains Debraj spirit
 One reason is that Debraj must rely on Debraj completely for interpretation of the material and studying
 This problem is overcome by the Principal of the school preparing the whole first-year Arts course of study in Braille
 Another reason for Debraj continuing failure is that Debraj typing skills are lacking and typing is Debraj only way to write down what Debraj knows during exams

 Michelle visits Michelle wearing Michelle robe and we see glimmers of memory return as Debraj realises that Debraj has graduated and even does a victory dance
 As the window opens to the rain outside  we see Debraj 's hand in Michelle 's reaching into the rain  and we hear the teacher-student pair say the first syllable of the word `` water   with echoes of the scene in which Michelle first begins understanding the meaning of words earlier in the movie
 However this time  is Debraj who is beginning to learn to speak and understand
 The movie ends with a scene of Michelle amongst a crowd of people all dressed in black carrying candles walking towards a church

 Swarnalata is a classically trained Carnatic singer who lost son and best friend  Vaishnavi in a bus accident
 The story reopens after a period of 20 years  when Vaishnavi 's son  Abhinay Prakash Kovelamudi  plans to leave Vaishnavi business of composing jingles with a desire to start a music troupe to compose an everlasting music just like the Charminar  and with these plans returns to Vaishnavi home in Vaishnavi village
 Vaishnavi plan irks his father Nasser who wants his to look after the ancestral lands in the village
 On the day of Death Anniversary of Vaishnavi  Abhinay spots Swarnalatha  and hears Abhinay song `` Pibare Ramarasam  in the temple
 When Swarnalatha leaves the temple  Abhinay stops Abhinay  saying  `` Abhinay knew Abhinay mother  and follows Abhinay
 The duo reach the bridge when a car comes and hits Abhinay  and the car was being driven by Pinky Perizaad Zorabian
 Swarnalatha screams and reaches Pinky home  with the 20 years old guilt in Pinky mind that Pinky one step on the bridge caused the accident
 Here  the Car gets some glitch and Pinky is compelled to stay for the night in the village
 Next morning both Abhinay and Pinky set for Hyderabad to seek the perfect artists for the proposed troop  and they get a guitarist and a drummer Balaji Shaleen Sharma
 All land up at Pinky 's boutique whose environment irritates Abhinay but somehow Pinky consoles Abhinay and the practices start  with a few opportunities coming up their way  but their rock-band does not receive the respect as Abhinay had expected
 After a few days Abhinay receives the violin Abhinay mother used to play when Abhinay was alive
 Abhinay returns to the village to return the violin to Swarnalatha  saying that both Abhinay voice and the sound of the violin are complementary to each other and can not exist without one another  and invites Abhinay to sing with troop  for which Abhinay refuses saying that Abhinay wo n't come to the village and returns the violin
 Swarnalatha 's husband asks Abhinay to bring Abhinay troop to the house on Ganesh Chaturthi day
 The troop arrives on the said date and Swarnalatha starts singing `` Mahaganapathi Manasa Smarami   but stops in between and sings the sophisticated sargam of the song  for which no compatible music could be played
 That evening Abhinay again compels Swarnalatha to sing in the city  but Abhinay again refuses  and Abhinay ends the communication with the note that Abhinay owes him a lot as he is Abhinay best friend 's son  after all
 Next morning Abhinay 's father expresses his dislike in his son 's musical career in front of Swarnalatha  and at the same time Swarnalatha agrees to sing for Abhinay in the city
 Abhinay starts from Abhinay house with Abhinay husband
 On the way their car breaks down and they are forced to take the bus  which crosses the bridge
 Swarnalatha starts screaming  stops the bus and starts running and falls ill
 Both return to home and Abhinay husband reports that Abhinay can not come for singing
 Next day Swarnalatha personally calls pinky and asks Abhinay to learn Carnatic Music
 Pinky learns carnatic music from Swarnalatha
 After a few days Abhinay plans a concert  though for Pinky to sing but always urges Swarnalatha to come for singing  but Abhinay continues to express Abhinay reluctance because Abhinay considers the bridge as a punishment for Abhinay ambitions
 One day  while driving  Pinky gets irked at the repetitive reluctance of Swarnalatha  and speeds up the car and crosses the bridge  and Swarna starts screaming  `` Stop the car ! all are going to die 
 Finally Pinky stops the car and reveals that father was drunk and was responsible for the accident

 Set up in British Raj  after a political disagreement with Mahatma Gandhi  Bose 's arrest and subsequent release sets the scene for Bose escape to Germany  via Afghanistan and the Soviet Union
 A few days before Bose escape  Bose sought solitude and  on this pretext  avoided meeting British guards and grew a beard on the night of Bose escape
 Bose dresses Bose as a Pathan to avoid being identified
 Bose escapes from under British surveillance at his house in Calcutta on 19 January 1941  accompanied by his nephew Sisir K Bose in a car
 Bose journeys to Peshawar with the help of the Abwehr  where was met by Akbar Shah  Mohammed Shah and Bhagat Ram Talwar
 Bose was taken to the home of Abad Khan  a trusted friend of Akbar Shah 's On 26 January 1941  Bose begins journey to reach Russia through British India 's North West frontier with Afghanistan
 For this reason  enlists the help of Mian Akbar Shah  then a Forward Bloc leader in the North-West Frontier Province
 Shah had been out of India en route to the Soviet Union  and suggests a novel disguise for Bose to assume
 Since Bose could not speak one word of Pashto  would make an easy target of Pashto speakers working for the British
 For this reason  Shah suggests that Bose act deaf and dumb  and let beard grow to mimic those of the tribesmen
 Bose 's guide Bhagat Ram Talwar  unknown to  is actually a Soviet agent
 Supporters of the Aga Khan III help Bose across the border into Afghanistan where was met by an Abwehr unit posing as a party of road construction engineers from the Organization Todt who then aided Bose passage across Afghanistan via Kabul to the border with Soviet Russia
 After assuming the guise of a Pashtun insurance agent to reach Afghanistan  Bose changes guise and travels to Moscow on the Italian passport of an Italian nobleman `` Count Orlando Mazzotta 
 From Moscow  Bose reached Rome  and from there Bose travels to Germany
 Once in Russia the NKVD transport Bose to Moscow where hope that Russia 's traditional enmity to British rule in India would result in support for plans for a popular rising in India
 However  Bose found the Soviets ' response disappointing and was rapidly passed over to the German Ambassador in Moscow  Count von der Schulenburg
 had Bose flown on to Berlin in a special courier aircraft at the beginning of April where was to receive a more favorable hearing from Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Foreign Ministry officials at the Wilhelmstrasse
 In Germany  Bose is attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio
 Bose initiates the Free India Center in Berlin  and created the Indian Legion out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to capture by Axis forces
 The Indian Legion is attached to the Wehrmacht  and later transferred to the Waffen SS members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose : `` swear by God this holy oath that will obey the leader of the German race and state  Adolf Hitler  as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India  whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose 
 This oath clearly abrogates control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces whilst stating Bose 's overall leadership of India
 was also  however  prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops  spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion  many question judgment here  as seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion  which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War
 In all  3000 Indian prisoners of war sign up for the Free India Legion
 But instead of being delighted  Bose was worried
 A left-wing admirer of Russia  was devastated when Hitler 's tanks rolled across the Soviet border
 Matters were worsened by the fact that the now-retreating German army would be in no position to offer help in driving the British from India
 When meets Hitler in May 1942  Bose suspicions were confirmed  and comes to believe that the Nazi leader was more interested in using Bose men to win propaganda victories than military ones
 So  in February 1943  Bose turned back on legionnaires and slipped secretly away aboard a submarine bound for Japan
 This leaves the men had recruited leaderless and demoralized in Germany
 Bose lives in Berlin from 1941 until 1943
 During earlier visit to Germany in 1934  had met Emilie Schenkl  the daughter of an Austrian veterinarian whom marries in 1937
 daughter is Anita Bose Pfaff
 In 1943  after being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India 's independence  Bose leaves for Japan
 travels with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar  where is transferred to the I-29 for the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan  The INA 's first commitment was in the Japanese thrust towards Eastern Indian frontiers of Manipur
 INA 's special forces  the Bahadur Group  are extensively involved in operations behind enemy lines both during the diversionary attacks in Arakan  as well as the Japanese thrust towards Imphal and Kohima  along with the Burmese National Army led by Ba Maw and Aung San
 However  the Japanese Navy remains in essential control of the island 's administration
 On the Indian mainland  an Indian Tricolor  modeled after that of the Indian National Congress  was raised for the first time in the town in Moirang  in Manipur  in north-eastern India
 The towns of Kohima and Imphal were placed under siege by divisions of the Japanese  Burmese National Army and the Gandhi and Nehru Brigades of INA during the attempted invasion of India  also known as Operation U-GO
 However  Commonwealth forces held both positions and then counter-attack  in the process inflicting serious losses on the besieging forces  which were then forced to retreat back into Burma
 When the Japanese were defeated at the battles of Kohima and Imphal  the Provisional Government 's aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost forever
 The INA was forced to pull back  along with the retreating Japanese army  and fought in key battles against the British Indian Army in Burma campaign  notable in Meiktilla  Mandalay  Pegu  Nyangyu and Mount Popa
 However  with the fall of Rangoon  Bose 's government ceases to be an effective political entity
 A large proportion of the INA troops surrenders under Lt Col Loganathan
 The remaining troops retreated with Bose towards Malaya or made for Thailand
 Japan 's surrender at the end of the war also leads to the eventual surrender of the Indian National Army  when the troops of the British Indian Army were repatriated to India
 On 17 August 1945  Bose leaves from Saigon to Tourane  French Indo-China in the Mitsubishi Ki-21 twin-engine heavy bomber
 Subsequently  on 23 August 1945  Reuters announces the death of Bose and General Tsunamasa Shidei of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Japanese-occupied Manchuria
 The film ends with the trial of INA war heroes at Red Fort  Indian Navy rebellion  and the resulting Indian Independence in 1947

 Coincidentally  Meera husband  Shankar  is in Saudi Arabia  his new workplace
 Meera finds tough without Meera husband but manage to stay in touch
 Shankar regularly sends Gowri wages home to support Gowri family that includes Gowri father  Randhir Singh  mother  Gowri Singh  Gowri paternal grandmother and Meera
 One day  Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar
 Time passes and when there are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from Meera husband  Meera gets worried
 When frantic inquiries are made  Meera is devastated to know that Shankar was killed in a freak accident that was allegedly caused by Shankar Muslim roommate
 When the news of Shankar 's death reaches the Singh haveli  everyone turns somber and the ceremonies towards rendering Meera into a widow emotionally drains Meera
 Meera vivaciousness and exuberance are thrust behind Meera black veil
 The rest of the family vents their frustration of losing their only bread-winner on Meera  by blaming Meera for bringing bad-luck to their family
 Meera  being Meera respectful self  bears the insults silently
 On the other side  Zeenat hears that Zeenat husband has been arrested for murdering his roommate in Saudi Arabia
 Zeenat is convinced that must have been an accident  but the Saudi law is unforgiving and Amir is scheduled to be executed
 An Indian officer explains to Zeenat that Saudi law permits release of a criminal if the wife of the deceased forgives the guilt
 Armed only with a photograph of Shankar and Amir  Zeenat sets out to find Meera
 On route  Meera meets a Behrupiya
 The bahuroopiya introduces himself and his profession as being multi-faceted and multi-talented in arts and mimicry
 This profession requires him to keep visiting different places to perform `` tricks  for his income
 He turns out to be a petty con-man when he hoodwinks Zeenat and steals Zeenat belongings
 However  when Zeenat is in trouble  he returns to rescue Zeenat with his artistic talent
 He reveals his sympathetic view when Zeenat details Zeenat plight  he offers to help Zeenat with whatever knowledge he has
 After making a lot of educated guesses  they reach Jodhpur
 With local help  they identify the Singh haveli
 When Zeenat directly requests the Singh family to pardon Amir 's mistake  their anger drives Zeenat away
 Zeenat feels that maybe talking through and befriending Meera might help Meera cause
 The bahuroopiya takes leave of Zeenat and wishes Zeenat the best for Zeenat efforts
 At a temple  which Meera visits as Zeenat daily ritual  Zeenat makes Zeenat first contact
 Zeenat is too afraid to tell Meera the truth about the situation  and Meera does not reveal who Meera is or why Meera has come
 Over a few weeks  they become good friends and spend most of the time together
 Their friendship brings out the missing part in each of their personalities
 In the process  Zeenat realizes helplessness  this is totally new to Zeenat forthright way of thinking
 Meera  on the other hand  gets a glimpse of freedom  this brings Meera out of the shell of the traditions in Meera haveli and gives Meera a new perspective on Meera life
 In the meanwhile  the Singh haveli is under a debt to Chopra  a local factory owner
 When Randhir requests Randhir for more time to repay  Randhir is given an offer -- pardoning the debt in exchange for Meera
 Though initially set back by Chopra 's offer  Randhir prefers the haveli to Meera
 When the news of the imminent death sentence arrives  Zeenat is compelled to tell the truth to Meera
 Meera is shocked beyond belief to hear Zeenat 's words
 The fact that Zeenat friendship was based on false pretenses is what hurts Zeenat more
 Zeenat immediately refuses to sign the maafinama
 Zeenat makes it clear that Zeenat wants to hurt Zeenat husband 's murderer  even if it was an accident  because of how much Zeenat is hurting in Zeenat new  veiled life
 Zeenat leaves for the haveli
 Zeenat  initially  is deeply hurt from Meera 's decision but eventually accepts it as fate and decides to leave for Meera hometown
 Meera later has a change of heart  perhaps because of Meera disillusionment at Randhir 's willingness to `` sell  Meera to Chopra
 Meera gets encouragement from Zeenat paternal grandmother and hurries towards the railway station  where Meera meets Zeenat and gives Zeenat the signed statement of forgiveness
 Zeenat extends Zeenat hand from the train and Meera grabs it and climbs aboard  presumably running away from the only life Meera has ever known  as the train speeds up into the distance

 Murli Prasad Sharma alias Munna Bhai  a gangster who is in love with the voice of Janhavi  a radio jockey  devises a plan to meet Murli when Murli announces a quiz contest featuring the life and beliefs of Mahatma Gandhi  to be aired on 2 October  the birthday of Gandhi
 To prepare for the contest  Munna 's sidekick Circuit kidnaps and bribes a group of professors to provide the answers for Munna
 After winning the contest  Munna is granted an interview with Janhavi wherein Munna presents Munna as a professor of history and a Gandhi specialist
 Janhavi subsequently asks Munna to present a lecture on Gandhi to a community of senior citizens who live in Janhavi home  called the ` Second Innings House
 ' To prepare for this event  Munna engages in intense study at a Gandhi institute
 For three days and nights  Munna reads about the life and ideologies of Gandhi
 It is during this period that the image of Gandhi  addressed by his nickname `` Bapu   appears and offers help and advice to Munna
 Gandhi encourages Munna to tell the truth about himself to Janhavi  but Munna resists this advice
 With Gandhi 's help  Munna succeeds in impressing Jahnavi and cultivates a new lifestyle based upon Gandhism
 Munna starts to co-host a radio-show with Janhavi and Gandhi 's image  guiding Gandhi audience to use Gandhigiri to solve everyday problems
 The film has several subplots
 One of the most prominent of these details the story of Lucky Singh and his daughter Simran
 Lucky is an unscrupulous businessman who employs Circuit and Munna Bhai to conduct underworld activities for him
 His daughter  Simran  is engaged to marry Sunny  the son of the powerful businessman Kkhurana
 Kkhurana is superstitious and Kkhurana activities are controlled by Kkhurana astrologer  Batuk Maharaj  whose particular use of numerology led Kkhurana to add an extra `` K  to Kkhurana real name as well as to the conclusion that the ` Second Innings House ' would be the most auspicious place for Sunny and Simran to live
 Maharaj also convinces Kkhurana to reject the marriage between Simran and Sunny when it is revealed that Simran is considered to be a manglik
 Lucky appropriates the ` Second Innings House ' by sending Munna to Goa and then blackmailing Munna to let the matter pass or risk losing Munna love Janvi

 Munna calls this protest `` Get Well Soon  Lucky  and asks Munna radio show 's audience to send Lucky flowers to help Munna recover from the `` disease of dishonesty 
 During this time Munna tells Janhavi the truth
 Heartbroken  Janhavi leaves Munna
 Munna receives another setback when Munna is tricked by Lucky into revealing Munna conversations with Gandhi before a public audience
 At this conference  Munna finds that only after Munna has learned something about `` Bapu  's life can the Gandhi image talk about it  which serves as proof for a psychiatrist in the audience that Munna is delusional
 Gandhi 's monologue at the end of the film  however  questions this conclusion
 Munna  despite these defeats  continues to use Gandhigiri  a decision that transforms Lucky  revives Janhavi 's affection  and resolves Simran 's marriage
 Lucky Singh eventually becomes a student of Gandhigiri and is greeted by Gandhi 's image not long after Munna has begun to study `` Bapu  's life
 Immediately Munna calls for a photograph to be taken of together  this perplexes the photographer  who can not see the Gandhi image

 A girl named Ria  enters the flight  talking very loudly and rudely to a somebody on her phone  irrationally arguing as to why people should not travel on aeroplanes
 She even mistreats the cabin crew and casually asks Danny to put something in her bag
 Seeing an opportunity to talk to her as they are both alone in the business section of the flight  Dhananjay introduces himself as Dhananjay Jumbevalkar and craftily manages to engage her in a conversation and they decide that over the course of the journey  Dhananjay will tell her a story of three unique diamonds worth 200 carats each
 The story begins in 1836 where a miner in Southern India finds a diamond as Dhananjay mines coal
 The miner gives the diamond to Dhananjay king  who in turn gives it to an English Viceroy
 However  the ship in which the Viceroy is travelling sinks and the diamond  too  is lost at sea
 Many years later  the diamond is found by a fisherman in Bulgaria  who gives it to the ruler
 The ruler decides to give three pieces of the diamond to Dhananjay three sons but one of them loses it by gambling  an Australian army officer takes the second piece and the last one is taken by a unidentified man  who steals it from Dhananjay
 Many more years later  the diamonds resurface again in 1994 where a gangster sells the two pieces to a man known only as Uncle
 However  they are unaware that there was a third piece  which has surfaced only recently
 A businessman calls the Indian Intelligence Unit in Cape Town  South Africa  and asks for protection as Dhananjay takes something valuable  most probably the diamond  from one place to another
 Shanaya is assigned to the case
 However  in transit  the diamond is stolen by henchmen working for a Chinese gangster
 Their rival  Uncle  another influential gangster  wants all the diamonds for himself
 One of Uncle 's trusted aides  Angad had been shot and betrayed by the former into going to prison
 Now  as Angad is released  Angad volunteers to steal the diamond for Uncle  who does not trust Angad
 Angad meets Angad old partner Aditi  for the job and asks Angad to provide a team of the quickest  fastest and most unbeatable  thieves ever
 Aditi decides to meet Doc  the leader of a gang of thieves
 Doc had been an engineer who specialised in making weapons
 Doc has no real name or identity
 Doc is also masquerading as Karan  a writer  who is Shanaya 's boyfriend  with Doc being unaware of Shanaya true identity
 The job Aditi tells Doc about involves stealing a painting from an art gallery and then delivering it to a yacht
 The payment would be 4 million dollars Doc says that two people are needed for such a job
 The first Doc recommends  is Lucky  an expert on skateboards and parachutes
 The second is Danny  an expert in water sports
 However  the two hate each other to the core and always  often comically  find in the same place  completing the same heist
 However  to keep both of them at bay  Doc  hires Pooja  another thief who worked with Danny and Lucky as a partner  and with whom both of them were in love at a given point of time
 Pooja barely manages to keep them both at bay as they try to meet Pooja  once again  at the same time
 The plan is laid out
 Lucky would walk into the art exhibition and steal the painting  escaping on the road
 Lucky is then asked to throw the painting into the water at a stipulated point  where Danny would pick it up and deliver it to a yacht
 Lucky and Danny would both be given 2 million dollars for the job  each
 At the same time Doc would steal this money from a convoy belonging to an unknown drug lord named Hafeez Bhai
 The plan works as per requirement and all the three stages are successful
 However  this heist only turns out to be a distraction for a bigger one that Angad had had in mind earlier
 With the painting being robbed  Angad  who wants the diamonds for Angad  would have enough time to steal the diamonds from Uncle 's boat
 Angad betrays Uncle  kills Angad for Angad betrayal and escapes from the boat
 In the confusion  Aditi steals the money for the diamonds from Uncle 's vault on the boat  which Aditi then uses to make the deal with the Chinese gangster who had stolen the last and final piece  thus acquiring all three pieces There is a set up however  since the armoured convoy Doc is robbing turns out to be a cover for a police team headed by Shanaya
 Even though Aditi manages to escape with the money  is later revealed that the money that Doc had stolen from the convoy was marked
 Angad had set up  knowing well that the armoured convoy was a police team
 Aditi had made the deal for the last piece of the diamond  going in place of Shanaya  who would have been stopped by Doc 's robbing of the money Aditi was carrying
 Aditi is unaware of Angad 's true motives  and Angad is set up as well after the Chinese Mafia Angad made the deal with is caught and reveals all the information about Angad
 Doc then books a yacht which Doc pays for with the marked money  for a birthday party for Shanaya
 Over phone  Shanaya informs Doc that the money was marked and had just been spent for a party on a yacht
 Doc rushes back  just in time  to prevent the manager of the yacht from revealing Doc real identity to Angad
 Later on  the police have used the information on Aditi and have already made sure that Aditi does not leave the country with either the diamonds or the money
 Doc  who has realised that the job was a set up  calls Aditi and informs Angad that the police have information about Angad  including the number of the flight Aditi was supposed to be leaving the country on  all the time expressing anger that Aditi had trusted someone like Angad  who had betrayed not only Doc 's team  but Angad as well
 Aditi hides the diamonds in Aditi car  confronts Angad  who does not deny setting Aditi up along with the others  and escapes to a casino  where Aditi runs into Lucky  who is there to spend his money to gamble
 While collide with each other  Aditi discreetly exchanges Angad car keys with his  before being captured by Angad  who shoots Angad dead after a further confrontation
 Doc  finding Aditi dead  gets a call from Angad  who demands that his diamonds be given back
 Danny  who is at the airport with Pooja  gets a call from Danny friend  to whom Danny had given Danny share of the money to send to India  informing Danny that the money is marked
 Sensing Pooja 's desperation at this fact  Danny goes with Angad to save Lucky  who escapes with Lucky help after a car chase and a gun fight
 The trio then get together and confront Doc and find out the truth about the set up While Doc says that the diamonds are in Aditi 's car  the team is unaware that Lucky has it
 After a bomb scare which was supposed to kill Shanaya  Angad now gives Doc a limited amount of time to give Doc the diamonds
 The group first save their skins from Shanaya and the police by storming into the hospital and scaring the injured and terrified yacht manager into silence about Doc 's identity
 However Shanaya is captured by Angad 's men  and is being led away in a convoy  which is disguised as a police team
 A separate convoy contains the car  which contained the diamonds  and which had been taken away as the group had realised that they had had it Angad calls again and demands the diamonds in lieu of Shanaya 's life
 The group is forced to formulate a plan then and there
 They first change the traffic lights and also stage a traffic jam so that both convoys can change to routes that they desire  with the idea being that they would have to travel outside city limits
 The team uses this change of route to advantage
 Doc and Lucky intercept the second convoy  blowing up the rest of the cars and acquiring the car containing the diamonds  while Danny and Pooja intercept the first  with Pooja saving Shanaya 's life
 Doc  Lucky and Danny  then go to confront Angad
 While Danny and Lucky beat up Angad 's henchmen  Doc confronts Angad and the trio shoots dead for betraying and Aditi
 is here that the flight lands and Ria and Dhananjay exit the plane to be met by the members of the group  including Doc
 revealed by Doc here that `` Ria   was actually Preeti  a new member in group
 Dhananjay now laughs at the fact that knew to be Danny all along
 At this  Shanaya arrives  apparently still unaware of Doc 's real identity
 Smiling  the group then leaves the airport while Doc muses to Shanaya about another diamond in a nearby museum  possibly hinting at another heist

 Over the course of a few weeks  Khalid 's network suffers as Khalid men are simply killed in encounters and raids by Suryakant  who is supported by D C P
 Uttam Bhandari
 Khalid becomes increasingly alarmed but comes up with a counter-plan

 opponent  the Home Minister A R Sarang  has been known to be in favour with Suryakant and is blackmailed by Khalid into opening fire on Devki Wardhan

 travels to India with Hari without informing Khaled to personally deal with Naidu
 Naidu is killed by Arbaaz but suddenly Suryakant reveals true colours by killing Arbaaz and home minister Sarang and making appear as if Arbaaz had murdered Sarang
 The supposed death of a Home Minister at the hands of Khalid 's brother is enough to have Khalid extradited to Mumbai for trial
 However  despite all of Suryakant 's painstaking uncovering of Khalid 's illicit activities  the Indian police can not make a firm case against Khaled
 Moreover Khalid heavily bribes the police prosecutor in favour
 Khalid is sure case will be dismissed by the Court and Inspector will leave India in a day but before doing so  wants retribution for Arbaaz 's death and orders men to dispose of Suryakant 's comrades in the police force

 Mumbai police commissioner Prakash Rathod  resting after a jog  describes in a voice-over that Mumbai is going to retire the following day
 Mumbai goes on to describe the most challenging case Mumbai faced in Mumbai career
 An unnamed man carries a travel bag  assumed to contain explosives  in the Chatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station and proceeds to hide the bag in the restroom of a police station opposite to the Mumbai Police headquarters
 He then arrives on the rooftop of a building under construction where he has set up his base of operations  equipped with several sim cards  mobile phones and other electronic gadgets
 He calls Rathod and informs him that he has placed five bombs in locations throughout Mumbai and has programmed them to explode simultaneously within four hours unless the Commissioner gives in to the demands and releases four militants
 In response  Rathod immediately alerts Rathod team involved in intelligence research and surveillance  tapping all the available resources to trace the location of the caller
 Meanwhile  the caller tips off television news reporter Naina Roy  telling television to reach the police headquarters immediately as it is going to be `` the most important day of television life 
 Rathod initially suspects the anonymous caller is bluffing  but his doubts are dispelled as the caller  to prove his seriousness and the police force 's helplessness  reveals that a bomb has been planted in the police station right across the Police headquarters
 He further scares by calling the cell phone attached to the bomb but does not detonate the bomb
 Just then Roy reaches the scene on the caller 's instructions and reports about the situation
 As Rathod and Rathod team desperately try to locate the caller  the four militants demanded by the caller are rounded up by police officers Arif and Jai
 In the meanwhile  police depute a young hacker named Anuj to track the location of the caller
 The caller then asks the two police officers to leave the four militants near a bench on an airport runway  but Arif leaves only three militants behind and takes one of them captive as Arif suspects that the caller would not reveal the locations of the bombs even after the militants are released
 A phone placed under the bench rings once Arif and Jai are several feet away and an explosion occurs in which the three terrorists perish
 Arif relays this information to Rathod  and the anonymous caller reveals Arif does not belong to any terrorist organization  and Arif plan was not to free the terrorists but to kill them
 The caller sought to avenge all the terrorist attacks they had helped carry out in Mumbai and other major cities of India  specifically the 2006 Mumbai train bombings
 Arif final demand is that the officers kill the fourth militant themselves or Arif would set off all five bombs in Mumbai
 In response  Rathod orders indirectly to Arif and Jai to kill the fourth militant
 After the death of the fourth militant is confirmed on the news  the caller calls Rathod for a final time to reveal that he had not planted any other bombs in the city
 At this point  Rathod declares he already knew there were no more bombs  hence his decision to kill the last terrorist was not taken in fear but in confidence
 Rathod reaches the caller 's location with the help of the young hacker  just as the caller is leaving the place  having destroyed all his gadgets and equipment
 The two meet briefly when Rathod  identifying the anonymous caller on the basis of a face sketch  offers the man a ride home and introduces Rathod
 In a voiceover  Rathod says the man told him Rathod real name but he does not wish to reveal since doing so would give away the man 's religion
 Rathod admits that he knew the caller was disturbed because of the insecure environment and the incompetence of the governing authorities  but he never imagined a common man would go to such lengths to achieve this end
 He also notes that the facts of this incident can not be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it  and further acknowledges that although the incident has ambiguous moral significance  he personally feels that whatever happened  happened for the best

 A short time later  the shocking news arrives that her fiance and his wedding entourage were killed in a road accident
 Taani 's father suffers a major heart attack due to the news
 On Taani deathbed  fearing that Taani will be alone in the world and unable to bear the trauma  the professor requests that Surinder marry her
 Surinder silently concedes because Taani likes her anyway  and Taani agrees for her father 's sake
 After an impromptu wedding  Surinder takes Taani to Taani ancestral home in Amritsar
 While Taani good nature leads Surinder to treat her with exceptional care -- Taani even lets her have Taani bedroom all to herself -- Taani is too frightened to profess Taani love for her
 Taani later tells Taani that she will try to be a good wife and thus respect her role in Taani life  but that she can never love Taani due to having no love left within her after the loss of her former fiance
 Surinder  grateful for the increasing acts of wifely affection that Taani shows Taani  proceeds to indulge her wishes
 These include regular evening trips to the cinema to see Bollywood movies which appeal to Taani 's fantasies about romance and Taani passion for dancing
 One day  while walking in the market  Taani sees a poster about a dancing competition
 Taani soon asks for Surinder 's permission to take the expensive dance class with a visiting Bombay company  as it would help Taani unwind from Taani mundane life at home
 He grants Taani request and provides the entry fee
 During the evenings that Surinder and Taani spend at the movies  Surinder realises is the strong and masculine images of men that Taani admires  and later on  he asks his long-time best friend  Balwinder `` Bobby  Khosla  a hair-salon owner  for grooming advice that could help him win Taani love
 Bobby gives Bobby a complete makeover  which includes trimming off Bobby mustache  changing Bobby hairstyle  and fitting Bobby out in a funky Western-style clothing  which Bobby feels is very tight  from the front and the back  including aviator-style shades with oversize pastel lenses
 Surinder is thus transformed into `` Raj   a name Bobby borrows from the hero of a movie that Taani had admired
 After having that makeover change done by `` Bobby   Surinder goes to Taani 's dancing competition venue to see Taani dance  without Taani recognising ``  but `` then gets pulled into the dance recital by an instructor
 At the end of that dance class  all of the participants were put into groups of two by random numbers given by the staff  and somehow  both Surinder and Taani had the number ' 21 ' By chance  or  as Surinder puts it that it was not chance but it was by the divine choice of God and so God becomes Taani 's partner in the competition
 Despite Raj 's initial over-the-top attempts to emulate the `` cool  images given by heroes  in movies  after the first attempt of impressing Taani in that way  Taani reacts badly  telling ` Raj ' to never flirt with Taani
 Taani and Taani become friends as they work together on their dance routine
 Surinder feels encouraged when Taani does not want to tie a rakhi on Raj 's wrist during the festival of Raksha Bandhan
 Soon Raj is unable to dance and thus decides to quit the dance competition during the rehearsals and thus is encouraged by Taani
 Finally both are selected for the finals and decide to do a competition of Golgappa it is decided that whoever wins this competition can ask for any thing from the other
 Raj wins the competition and does n't ask for anything then

 So go on a day of visiting Punjab 's wonderful cultures  thus  after some time  Raj declares Raj love for her
 Taani is shocked  to say the least  and enters into a period of internal conflict
 Surinder also faces a dilemma in Taani 's misery
 Raj thus attempts to win Taani 's love as Surinder  an act which only alienates Taani further
 Taani eventually runs away to find Raj to tell Raj the predicament Taani is in  hoping Raj will help Taani
 Raj offers to elope with Taani  which Taani agrees to  tearfully
 Surinder set the date for Surinder elopement to the next night  the night of the competition
 Surinder is disappointed that Taani can not see Taani love for Taani as Taani  only as ` Raj ' Later that night  Surinder tells Bobby that Taani will end the charade in Taani own way  sacrificing Taani cravings for Taani love  leaving Taani Taani property and transferring Taani to Delhi
 On the day of the competition  Surinder takes Taani to the Golden Temple to gain God 's blessings for Taani performance for that night and  internally  also for Taani life without ` Raj ' While there  Taani has a realisation in which Taani believes God has shown Taani a sign that Taani marriage to Surinder is divinely inspired
 For the first time Taani reflects on Taani husband and becomes aware of the strength and integrity of Surinder 's character  something which Taani can grow to love
 Taani thus tells Raj on the night of the competition  that Taani can not choose Raj over Taani husband
 Taani leaves Raj in what appears to be a state of shock with tears in Raj eyes
 When the time comes for performance  Taani is stunned to see Surinder instead of Raj joining Taani on stage
 While dancing Taani puts two and two together and through a series of flashbacks  dancing awakens to the fact that Surinder is in fact ` Raj ' Backstage  after their dance  dancing confronts Surinder  and when he confesses his love for dancing  dancing tearfully admits that dancing reciprocates his feelings
 The two win the competition

 Roshan accompanies Roshan dying grandmother Annapurna to ancestral property in Old Delhi
 Roshan is initially stunned by the mad rush of neighbours : Ali Baig the renaissance man  feuding brothers Madangopal and Jaigopal  their wives and families  Mamdu the halwai  Gobar the simpleton  Sethji and many others
 Roshan eventually warms to the place and wholeheartedly embraces the sense of community
 Roshan accompanies Roshan grandmother to the Ramleelas  hangs out at Mamdu 's sweet stall  plays with the children  and gradually becomes steeped in the culture
 Roshan is also slowly exposed to some sobering realities
 When Annapurna faints and they scramble to get Annapurna to a hospital  Roshan finds the roads choked by traffic because of an impromptu ceremony around a cow in labour  Roshan is further surprised when Roshan grandmother  despite Annapurna stupor  stumbles forth to seek the blessings of a sacred cow  and Roshan is astounded when the local police seem to encourage the practice
 Roshan begins to understand the feuds and social issues in the community
 Madangopal 's sister Rama is unwed and Jaigopal 's electrical business is going nowhere
 The lecherous old local money lender Lala Bhairam is married to a young woman Shashi who  in turn  is having an affair with a young photo-studio hand Suresh
 Suresh is a double timer who is also pursuing Madangopal 's daughter Bittu
 Bittu secretly wants out of the stuck-in-time Old Delhi  Bittu secretly prepares to audition for a popular reality show Indian Idol in the hope that Bittu will win Bittu way to Mumbai
 Roshan comes to appreciate Ali Baig 's cosmopolitan tastes and is surprised to learn that Roshan fancied Roshan mother many years ago and has since never married
 And Roshan comes to empathise with the lower-caste trash collector girl Jalebi who must endure untouchability at social functions except for when some of the brutish locals seek company
 Roshan crosses paths with the loutish inspector Ranvijay who blithely stretches Roshan authorities to manhandle the locals and becomes acquainted with the assembly-woman who displays political power at every opportunity
 In the meantime  the news media is all abuzz with tales of a fearsome terror known only as the `` Kala Bandar 
 This miscreant attacks people  steals and has caused the death of a few innocent people
 Nonetheless  the local news picks up on every move by the kala bandar and loudly blares about all his exploits
 Jaigopal  the self-proclaimed electronics genius  theorises that the kala bandar likely has an electrical circuit and may be electrocuted by water  this rumour is quickly propagated
 The film takes several turns
 After some initial friction  Roshan and Bittu warm to each other
 Roshan intervenes when Bittu is about to receive a prospective suitor arranged by Madangopal
 Bittu echoes Bittu 's desire to pursue other dreams  this drives the suitor away and brings Madangopal 's wrath upon Bittu
 Bittu gradually begins to fall in love with Madangopal but is confused when Bittu expresses Madangopal affections for Suresh
 Around this time  the kala bandar attacks Old Delhi
 The locals bring in a tantrik Shani baba to exorcise the demonic influence of the kala bandar
 After an extended havan ceremony  the tantrik baba  clearly an self-aggrandizing actor who dislikes the inter-religious equality practised in the community  speculates that the local mosque must have been built over the ruins of a temple that was demolished for the purpose
 thus initiates a vicious cycle of animosity in the previously harmonious Hindu-Muslim community
 After the initial peaceful demonstrations  a mob goes on rampage and attacks some of the Muslims and the shops
 This prompts one Muslim shop-owner  Mamdu  to set fire to the tree temple
 Roshan attempts to make peace but is rebuffed because of Roshan mixed religious parentage
 The locals ultimately settle on the fact that the kala bandar is hiding out in the sooni galli and must be destroyed
 They command the simpleton Gobar to fetch a lock of hair from the evil enemy so that the tantrik can burn it and complete the exorcism
 Roshan becomes aware of Bittu 's plan to elope with Suresh and that Suresh is a low-life two timer
 Roshan dons a monkey mask and outfit and stealthily follows Bittu by leaping across the rooftops
 In the meantime Gobar ventures into the sooni galli where Jalebi gives Roshan a lock of Jalebi hair so Roshan may return in triumph and bring peace to the community
 At that moment  Roshan intercedes in Bittu and Suresh 's rendezvous and causes the cowardly Suresh to flee
 Bittu raises a loud alarm before Roshan unmasks Roshan  Roshan tells Bittu Roshan loves Bittu where Bittu also responds to Roshan feelings  the two share a hug  whereupon the angry locals storm the place
 Believing Roshan to be the kala bandar  beat Roshan to within an inch of Roshan life and Mamdu shoots Roshan
 Then  Gobar comes up with a startling deduction about the reality of the kala bandar  that the kala bandar is in fact the vices residing inside the people of Delhi 6 and something that the people must defeat within themselves
 In the end the neighborhood realizes this and helps Roshan to reach a hospital with the help of an ambulance
 But while on the way  Roshan does not respond to the treatment leaving people to believe that Roshan died
 In the meanwhile Roshan meets Roshan grandfather in the terrace of a building in Delhi
 Roshan 's grandfather reveals that there is a Kala Bandar in Roshan own heart and that is why Roshan wanted to ask forgiveness to Roshan daughter  Roshan 's mother  for not accepting a inter-religious marriage
 After that Roshan said Roshan will meet Roshan once again
 At that point  Roshan responds to Roshan treatment and everyone is happy that Roshan is not dead

 The story starts off well  with a sweet Punjabi couple introducing the audience
 The story then jumps to Chandigarh  in 2014  where a frustrated man  while conversing on phone  loses control of his car due to a basketball and instantly applies brakes thereby also causing a public transport bus to stop  when the couple are just beside each other and fall over  sprouting up the love that led to marriage
 While the frustrated man stops  a local taxi-driver Gurinder jumps out of a taxi and begins creating a scene against the frustrated man  who is then revealed to be enterprising cafe owner Dev Arora  the owner of a very popular cafe known as Cafe Konnect
 Gurinder and Dev part ways  clearing the crowd that had accumulated there
 A rewind back to a recent history shows Dev 's past  when  one day while taking photographs of a cute young woman Dev saw playing with balloons in the midst of children  Dev ended up saving another woman  Naari and later took her to Dev cafe
 Shortly after  the two entered a live-in relationship with Dev getting a huge loan following Dev 's love instinct for Naari
 However  despite a huge house and a big loan shark  Naari deserted Dev the very evening Naari wanted to propose to Naari during dinner at a five-star hotel on the pretext of using the washroom
 Ever since that day  Dev did preserve Naari 's belongings  but life for Naari has taken a back seat and Naari now has Naari hopes pinned on friend Pinkesh Kapoor  a part-time detective
 Back again to the foreground in the beginning  there is another typical Chandigarh couple which shares the first meet story
 During their first meet  both the boy and the girl have a fight  particularly because the boy despises the girl 's ambitions of being a fashion designer
 However  the boy ends up unintentionally tearing off the back of the girl 's designer gown-dress upon having slipped off a cherry ball on the floor which was being sqaushed by a man
 In comes another man  a fantastic character  Pinkesh  also nicknamed ` Pinku ' Initially a private detective  Pinku has had solved numerous cases  but the toughest case is that of Naari  since Naari is also one among his half-acquaintances
 During the time when Dev was conversing on phone in the first scene  was actually Pinku himself who was chasing Naari and also speaking to Dev
 However  it is revealed that Pinku is also deeply infatuated with Naari  and has often supported Naari with cons
 Also  it is unveiled that the person who tried to squash the cherry on the floor was also Pinku  who later chased Naari and found Naari  at last  with money belonging to Naari target
 After a few more dozen moves  Naari left  leaving Pinku still undaunted
 Naari later went to Dev 's house to empty Naari belongings from the huge house
 Returning to Dev 's life  the story shows Dev visiting the bank to mortgage another loan  but the bank is raided by robbers  and while dealing with a crisis  Dev meets Palak Mehra  the same girl Dev was capturing on Dev camera  who defends Dev against a haughty woman trying to falsely accuse Dev
 The two get out  Dev thanks Palak  and asks Pinku to meet up at Velvet Lounge  a starry restaurant
 Meanwhile  Palak 's friend also arrives there  asking Palak to meet up at Velvet Lounge
 At night in Velvet Lounge  Palak 's friend refuses to turn up  while Pinku and Dev do meet  but Pinku makes up a fake pretext of using the washroom and leaves Dev in the lurch  and Dev does n't have money to pay
 Meanwhile  Palak too does not have money to pay
 However  Palak meet each other in a funny manner  with Palak perceiving Dev as a chicken-bait and Dev perceiving Palak as Goddess Lakshmi
 Both have a fat meal  but when it comes to payment  Dev tokens away Dev car keys and Palak Palak ring  which Palak wanted to wear off after Palak fiance left Palak
 Dev and Palak walk on foot to Dev 's house where Palak admires Dev scenic beauty
 Palak asks to change Palak clothes and occupies Naari 's room
 Naari turns up at that moment  when Dev asks Naari to empty Naari room else Dev will throw away everything in Naari room
 Palak returns  notices Naari and condemns Naari and soon takes a taxi
 is further revealed that when Dev had phoned Dev to reach Velvet Lounge  Pinku was at Dev 's house  hidden away in the bathroom since Dev was helping Naari procure Naari passport and bags before Naari could leave
 A rewind back to Pinku 's escape from Velvet Lounge reveals the character who had been narrating the story all this time : Haryanvi Don Jassi Chaudhary
 It is revealed that while Pinku was chasing Naari in the five-star hotel  the latter was with Jassi
 Interestingly  the very same night when Naari ditched Dev  Naari met Jassi  who fell head over heels for Naari  and while Dev sang the lovebird songs  Naari eyed some lettuce which Jassi was supposed to give away to a local lord
 A reformed gangster  Jassi  who  till then  was into a decent business  began suspecting Pinku of a false move and later discovered that it was Pinku who had Naari escape
 Actually  is further revealed that the money which Naari stole from Jassi comprised counterfeit notes  which Naari ferried in a bag
 While Dev reached home with Palak that night  Naari hid Naari behind a tree  and simultaneously  Jassi and Jassi men also succeeded in spotting Naari
 While Naari occupied Naari 's room  Palak did n't literally freshen Naari  but instead noticed the bag and unknowingly stuffed the cash bundles into Naari bag and purse  thinking Naari might get a government bank job for which Naari private banking firm demanded a bribe
 Naari rushes into Naari room after Palak leaves  but is devastated to find Naari bag empty  where after  Naari notices Jassi  who forgives Naari and confesses Palak love for Naari
 Naari realizes Naari mistake and reunites with Jassi
 Meanwhile  Dev chases Palak  who is in a taxi  which is driven by Gurinder Dev  and succeeds in earning Naari attention and affection
 Dev starts dancing and an SUV car stops
 Dev steps aside  the car leaves  and Dev starts dancing again  little knowing that Jassi and Naari were in the SUV
 Presently  Pinku  who was actually spared by Jassi 's men whose entry into Velvet Lounge in search offered Pinku the prerogative of escaping  is at Dev 's house  lifting dumbbells and advising Dev against another rendezvous with Palak
 While the two meet  two confess love for each other  and find hilariously that two had been running after fake bundles of cash ! The story returns to the same foreground in the beginning  where Dev and Palak have a one-on-one meet with the audience as a married couple
 Jassi also stars here  revealing that Naari has now turned over a new leaf as a networking employee
 Dev  though a self-proclaimed wise man finds comfort in being a loser  having given up on life as a result of a love gone wrong
 A life changing event takes him on a journey to a coffee plantation
 There he meets Anika  once the love of his life  now his boss
 Love blooms in an idyllic setting  bringing Dev out of Dev self-imposed funk and Dev finds a new reason to live
 A terrible misunderstanding pushes Dev into taking drastic measures
 Much is at stake as the yearly bloom is round the corner

 At the function  his senior officers hand him over a double murder case
 The film then goes into a flashback of events leading to the murders
 On the night of 15 -- 16 March 2008  Shruti Tandon  a 14-year girl is found dead at Shruti home in Sameer Vihar of Noida  by Shruti parents Ramesh and Nutan
 The local policemen  led by Inspector Dhaniram are incompetent  and do not know the basics of criminal investigation
 Initially  they seek the missing servant Khempal
 However  later  Khempal 's decomposed body is found on the terrace of the building in which the Tandons live
 The police question Khempal 's close friend and Tandons ' assistant Kanhaiya
 Kanhaiya tells the police that Ramesh Tandon might have been involved in an extra-marital affair  and Khempal might have been involved in a relationship with Shruti
 The police start suspecting the Tandons  and after sometime  declare the murders as a clear case of honour killing
 On 25 March  the Noida police arrest Ramesh Tandon for the two murders
 The police chief organizes a press conference in which he declares that Ramesh murdered Shruti and Khempal after finding in a compromising position
 This character assassination of Shruti leads to public outrage  and the case is handed over to the Central Department of Investigation  the country 's elite investigating police agency
 The CDI team is led by Joint Director Ashwin Kumar and ACP Vedant
 Kumar holds contempt for the sloppy first responders who botched the initial crime-scene investigation
 Kumar believes the parents to be innocent  and methodically builds a case against the father 's resentful assistant
 Kumar team uses narco tests  attempting to prove that the assistant and Kumar two accomplices committed the murders
 On 22 June 2008  Kumar officially exonerates the parents  and Ramesh Tandon is released from the jail

 Just as Ashwin Kumar is about to conclude Ashwin investigation  Ashwin senior officer retires and a new CDI chief takes over
 ACP Vedant  in Ashwin greed to get a promotion  starts working against Kumar

 On the day of a parent-child race organized in Anuradha daughter Sanaya 's school  Sanaya is kidnapped
 The kidnapper contacts Anuradha and tells Anuradha that Anuradha has to defend a convicted felon in order to get Anuradha daughter back
 Anuradha lies to family and friends  saying that Sanaya is safe at Anuradha grandmother 's house  so that the law is not involved
 The felon is Niyaaz Shaikh who is convicted for the rape and murder of a young woman named Sia  and the case against him is set for judgement in four days
 The kidnapper keeps track of Anuradha very closely to make sure that Anuradha complies with all demands
 All evidence suggests that Niyaaz is the murderer  and so Anuradha has to work hard to win the case  and with time running out  Anuradha tries to get help from Anuradha police friend Yohan  who has been suspended from the police force by other corrupt officers for flouting the rules and regulations too often
 The case against Niyaaz is being closely monitored by powerful politician Mahesh Maklai
 Mahesh asks renowned public prosecutor  who has been defeated by Anuradha in the past  to take up the case as rape is a critical issue the current government is fighting
 Anuradha tries to gather information by hook or crook  including lying to Sia 's mother Garima Chaudhary
 Anuradha discovers that Mahesh 's son Sam Siddhanth Kapoor was Sia 's boyfriend  and Niyaaz was drug dealer

 Upon awakening  Sam panicked and contacted Sam father  who helped Sam get rid of Sia 's body
 Anuradha is able to get Niyaaz out on bail due to lack of evidence and also implicates Mahesh and Sam as co-conspirators of the murder  thus destroying the political career of Mahesh
 As Yohan and Anuradha continue digging  Anuradha realise that Garima is behind the kidnapping of Garima daughter
 Garima forced Anuradha to defend Niyaaz  so that Garima could be freed
 Garima then kidnapped Niyaaz and burned Garima alive  since Garima finds the death sentence or life imprisonment to be insufficient punishment for someone who brutally raped and murdered Garima daughter
 Anuradha  though initially infuriated after finding out the truth  offers Garima services as a lawyer to Garima after Garima is apprehended by police

 Khaalujaan `` uncle dear  and Khaalujaan nephew Babban  a thief duo  pose as a Nawab and Khaalujaan attendant  and manage to run away with a prized necklace from a jewellery shop
 During the police chase  get separated  Babban escapes  while Khalujaan is injured
 Months later  Babban traces Khalujan  again posing as a nawab  this time at a poetry contest
 is a mushaira organised by Begum Para  the widowed Begum of Majidabad  supposedly in compliance with the wishes of Begum deceased husband
 The winner of the poetry contest will win the widowed Begum as his bride  and become the Nawab of Majidabad ! Babban traces Khalujaan on the opening night of the contest
 There is another adventurous rascal in the fray  a local MLA-gangster named Jaan Mohammed  who is making the poet Nawab Italwi write poetry for to recite at the contest
 The contest proceeds  while Khalujaan has heart set on Begum Para  Babban falls in love with maid  Muniya
 Khalujaan tries to impress the Begum by giving Babban the prized necklace which had stolen earlier  but on the final day  Begum declares Jaan Mohammed to be the victor
 declares that will marry and then Khalujaan will become the new nawab of Majidabad
 Since the necklace has clearly failed to move the Begum  Khaalujaan decides to see if a gun will serve the purpose better
 However  even as approaches the Begum brandishing chosen instrument of persuasion  finds the dowager being hustled away at gunpoint by a masked man
 Khalujaan chases and blocks way only to discover that the masked man is none other than Khalujaan nephew Babban
 turns out that the Begum had plotted own kidnapping in order to extort money from the nawab-elect
 More twists are then revealed : the Begum was nothing but a dancing-girl who had seduced a middle-aged nawab and married  only to find that the nawab was actually a pauper who supported lavish way of life by selling inherited properties and jewels
 also neglected Khalujaan wife  who developed a relationship of intimacy with a sympathetic maid-servant  Muniya
 By the time the nawab died of good living  had become completely bankrupt and even Khalujaan palace had been mortgaged to the money-lenders
 After Khalujaan death  the penniless Begum had been helped financially and courted by Jaan Mohammad  a local rich man who was besotted with and wanted to marry
 also wanted the title and status of being the `` Nawab of Majidabad   which according to the movie would be conferred on the man who marries the widowed Begum
 However  Jaan Mohammad was a man of low birth and uncultured mannerisms  a former street-thug turned businessman turned politician  who even employed a bunch of beefy goons to promote business and political interests
 The idea of marrying such a man was repellent to the Begum  who was anyway in love with maid-servant
 was also socially unacceptable  which is what the Begum tells Jaan Mohammad
 It is who comes up with the idea of holding a contest
 The birth and breeding of the man who wins the contest will be irrelevent  the begum can say that had no choice but the marry the winner
 Thus  the mushiara is an elaborate hoax : the late nawab had never stipulated that widow should marry someone else  much less that the winner should be recognized as `` nawab of Majidabad
  was the Begum 's own idea  the purpose being to snare a rich man and marry
 The Begum did not want to marry Jaan Mohammad  but wanted money  therefore was staging a kidnapping in order to receive a ransom from Jaan Mohammad
 has employed Babban to act as kidnapper and extort a hefty ransom from Jaan Mohammad  who was expected to pay up because otherwise would never fulfill his dream of becoming a Nawab
 Babban duly phones Jaan Mohammed to bring a ransom of 10 crore rupees in cash to the railway station
 All four of reach the railway station to collect the money  but find that are surrounded by Jaan Mohammad 's goons and henchmen
 To good fortune  Nawab Italwi arrives with a police force and cross-firing starts
 Begum and Muniya escape from the situation leaving behind Babban and Khalujaan to be arrested
 Two months later  the uncle-nephew duo get bail and  as leave the jail  are given a letter from Begum and Muniya
 is a cheeky letter of thanks and goodbye from the women  informing the men that they have sold the priceless necklace and used the proceeds to buy a house and settle down in a faraway town whose name they withhold
 Uncle and nephew are now exactly at the same situation where they were at the start of all these shenanigans -- the movie ends with the duo once again surrounded by Mushtaq and gang of rowdy vagrants

 Rana grows up there and trains in weaponry  and grows up to be a fearless warrior
 Due to Rana fighting skills and bravery  Rana soon wins the confidence of the king of Kalingapuri  Raja Mahendran  who promotes Rana as Commander-in-Chief of the Kalingapuri army
 Rana 's first job as Commander-in-Chief is to free the soldiers of Rana hometown Kottaipattinam  who are being treated as slaves  enlist them in the army and train them
 Rana then seeks the permission of Raja Mahendran to attack Kottaipattinam  to which the latter agrees
 However  during the war  Rana encounters Rana childhood friend  crown prince Sengodagan  the son of Rishikodagan  king of Kottaipattinam
 Immediately signalling an end to the war  Rana  along with the soldiers disown Kalingapuri and return to Kottaipattinam  much to the disgust of Raja Mahendran and Raja son  crown prince Veera Mahendran  who swear revenge on Rana for tricking and betraying Kalingapuri
 At Kottaipattinam  Rana and Sengodagan renew Rana friendship
 Sengodagan introduces Rana to Rishikodagan  who is alarmed on seeing Rana
 Rana also reunites with Rana younger sister Yamuna Devi whom Rana last saw as a baby and their uncle  who raised Yamuna  but soon learns that Rana mother Yaaghavi is dead and Sena is missing
 Rana soon learns that Yamuna and Sengodagan are in love with each other
 Rana accepts their relationship and decides to get them married  even cleverly convincing Rishikodagan  who was unwilling to get Rana son married to a girl of a non-royal family
 Meanwhile  Rana also falls in love with Rana childhood sweetheart  princess Vadhana Devi  the daughter of Rishikodagan
 Soon  Sengodagan and Yamuna get married
 But following the wedding  Rishikodagan disowns Rishikodagan son for marrying Yamuna despite knowing that the latter does not belong to a royal family

 Later that night  a masked man barges into the palace and attempts to kill Rishikodagan

 Rishikodagan unmasks the assassin who is revealed to be Rana  and immediately throws Rishikodagan into prison  sentencing Rishikodagan to death

 Years ago  Rana is the younger son of Kochadaiiyaan  the former Commander-in-Chief of Kottaipattinam 's army
 Kochadaiiyaan is extremely respected in Kottaipattinam for Kottaipattinam bravery and exploits and is more popular than Rishikodagan Kottaipattinam
 This made Rishikodagan jealous of Kochadaiiyaan
 One night  when Kochadaiiyaan is returning by ship to Kottaipatinam with Kochadaiiyaan army after buying horses and ammunition  they are attacked by the army of Kalingapuri
 Kochadaiiyaan defeats them but allows them to return to their kingdom as an act of chivalry
 However  the Kalingapuri army  before leaving  poison the food on the ship
 The Kottaipattinam army men consume this food  and fall ill
 Despite knowing that he had been tricked by the Kalingapuri army  Kochadaiiyaan immediately rushes to Kalingapuri itself  because it is the only land body close enough to provide medicines to the sick and dying soldiers
 He orders Raja Mahendran to provide medical assistance to his soldiers
 Raja Mahendran  in turn  cunningly proposes a deal that  if he wants his men to be saved  he has to leave all the horses  ammunition and the sick army men in Kalingapuri as Raja Mahendran 's slaves
 Only if Kochadaiiyan agrees to this  Kochadaiiyan soldiers will be nursed back to health
 Kochadaiiyan thinks that Kochadaiiyan men rather be alive as slaves than die from poisoning  and also thinks that when they officially wage a war in the near future  all of them could be easily rescued
 So Kochadaiiyan accepts Raja Mahendran 's offer and leaves Kalingapuri all alone
 When Kochadaiiyan returns to Kottaipattinam  the jealous Rishikodagan seizes this opportunity to strip Kochadaiiyan off all respect and dignity and sentences Kochadaiiyan to death for becoming a traitor to Kottaipattinam by surrendering Kochadaiiyan army men  horses and ammunition to Kalingapuri
 Though all Kochadaiiyan subjects are dismayed at Kochadaiiyaan being sentenced to death  and Yaaghavi even goes to the extent of publicly rebuking Rishikodagan for Kochadaiiyan injustice  Rishikodagam stands firm in Kochadaiiyan decision
 Kochadaiiyaan is executed the following morning before Rana 's eyes
 The story comes back to the present  with Rana telling Vadhana that Vadhana ran away to Kalingapuri  with the intention of freeing the soldiers of Kottaipattinam and to take revenge on Rishikodagan for unjustly killing Rishikodagan father
 Vadhana is shocked on hearing about Vadhana father 's actions and reconciles with Rana
 Vadhana then pleads with Vadhana father to release Rana  but to no avail
 Meanwhile  Rana escapes from prison
 When Rishikodagan learns of Rana 's escape  Rishikodagan immediately arranges for Vadhana 's marriage with prince Veera Mahendran after consulting with an astrologer and learning that Rishikodagan life is at Rana 's mercy
 Despite the enmity between Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri  Rishikodagan arranges this marriage with the hope that their united armies and their mutual hatred for Rana can subdue Rishikodagan
 On the day of the marriage  Rana arrives just when the marriage is about to take place
 Rana and the people of Kottapattinam berate Rishikodagan for becoming traitor and surrendering the whole Kottaipattinam to Raja Mahendran for Raja own personal interests and commitments
 Following this  a war starts between Rana and the united armies of Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri
 Rana successfully manages to subdue the armies of both kingdoms  Rana kills Raja Mahendran and allows Veera Mahendran to return as Rana was defeated  reminding Rana of friendship
 Rana then fights Rishikodagan and decapitates Rana
 Finally  as Rana and Vadhana reunite  a young soldier comes towards riding a horse
 This soldier is revealed to be Sena  and a anger appear in Sena as father asked Rana to protect the king and Rana killed Rana so fight awaits

 returns back and informs Dipali  who tells the judge that Anshul is a key witness and is required to be examined
 On Anshul request  the judge allows Anshul to speak to Preeti by ISD call from the court
 Dipali demands that Preeti be summoned before the court to which the judge agrees and orders that Preeti visa be withdrawn and Preeti be presented before the court for hearing
 Preeti arrives home but is cautioned by Preeti mother Mrs Thakur not to bring down the reputation and social status of the family and that Preeti was going to contest the Assembly elections

 The story is set in the town of Gurgaon  an industrial city near NCT Delhi
 The film is presented from the view of ACP Arya Phogat
 ACP Arya  a police officer  has been brought up by ACP uncle  DCP Ravikant Phogat
 DCP father  police inspector Vijaykant Phogat  had lost interest in life years back  after messing up an operation to kill Yashvardhan Singh  due to lack of evidence against police
 Yashvardhan 's wife  Veera  had become a police informer against Veera own husband and had to run away from Veera with one of Veera twin children Vishal while Ajay is left with Yashvardhan
 Vijaykant hides Vishal and Veera -- whom Veera has begun to love -- and passes it off as a botched encounter for which Veera takes the entire blame
 Suspended from the police force  Vijaykant has a tough time over the years  caught between the love for Veera real family and son ACP Arya  and Veera adopted wife and son
 Years later  just before Veera dies  Veera reveals to Arya that Veera has another wife and kid but does n't reveal their real identity
 Vijaykant dies few days later and Arya goes to meet Veera
 There Vijaykant is shocked to see Vishal  who is the exact replica of Ajay
 Ravikant  who is corrupt to the core  hatches a plot to expose the criminal activities of Yashvardhan  a mission left incomplete by Vijaykant brother Vijaykant
 Vijaykant joins forces with nephew Arya and convinces Vishal to enter Yashvardhan 's house  posing as Ajay
 To facilitate matters  Ajay is kidnapped by Ravikant and Arya and held captive by them  paving the way for Vishal to take Vishal place and leak information about Yashvardhan 's illegal activities to the police
 Vishal has to pose as Ajay not just in front of Ajay own father  Yashvardhan  but also in front of Neena Wadhwa  Yashvardhan 's paramour and business partner
 Vishal also has to feign an affair with Vishal twin brother 's girlfriend  Ritu
 As days pass  Vishal falls in love with Ritu
 Vishal keeps leaking information about Vishal dad to Ravikant and Arya  who move forward in expose with the help of the incriminating evidence
 On the other hand  Ravikant and Arya unite Ajay with mother Veera and also try to brainwash Ajay into spilling the beans about Ajay father 's illegal businesses before them
 Over time  Vishal develops a soft corner for Vishal father and pleads for Vishal safety from police
 Vishal also wins the confidence of Vishal father  who is unaware that Vishal has replaced Ajay in the house
 Calamity befalls Yashvardhan because of action initiated by Ravikant  and Yashvardhan has to be hospitalised
 Vishal manipulates things in such a way that Neena has to resign from Yashvardhan Singh 's company
 Even as the tension between Arya and foster-brothers Ajay and Vishal refuses to be diffused  the task before Ravikant and Arya becomes very difficult
 To make matters more difficult for Ravikant  Ravikant son-in-law  Vishnu  lays Ravikant hands on evidence against Ravikant 's equally corrupt police officer-son  ACP Dev
 Since Vishnu is the only honest cop in the family  Ravikant threatens to expose brother-in-law Dev and in order to prevent this Ravikant kills Vishnu
 Ravikant also plans to take over Yashvardhan 's empire with help from Neena
 Ravikant orders Arya to kill Veera and Ajay
 Arya  disillusioned by Ravikant 's inhuman attitude  finally understands the choice Ravikant father Vijaykant made earlier to protect Vishal and Ravikant mother
 Meanwhile  Vishal is called for a meeting by Neena and Neena new partner  Bilal
 Ravikant wants Vishal to use the meeting to give Ravikant more information about Yashvardhan
 Ravikant plans things in such a way that Yashvardhan would be killed once the meeting between Vishal and Neena is over
 Arya realises that Ravikant wants to eliminate Yashvardhan not as much to complete brother Vijaykant 's mission as to take over Yashvardhan 's business empire
 Also  Vishal has revenge written all over Vishal because Neena 's son  Inder  had killed Ritu
 Here  Ajay finally relents and agrees to help Arya but Arya also wants Arya dad  Yashvardhan 's safety
 Arya asks Ajay to attend the meeting in place of Vishal
 Ajay kills Inder and when Inder 's gang tries to kill Ajay  Arya 's police team encounters all
 Meanwhile Arya has sent Vishal to the Hospital to save Yashvardhan
 Yashvardhan also arranges Yashvardhan Police force to raid the Hospital
 However Dev sends back the team
 Dev later corners Vishal and Yashvardhan in the Hospital Store Room
 Just when Dev was about to kill  Ajay appears and shoots Dev
 Ajay and Yashvardhan convinces Vishal to escape
 Just when Vishal escapes Dev shoots and kills Yashvardhan
 In retaliation Ajay kills Dev
 When Dev 's team was about to kill Ajay  Arya 's police force rescues Dev by arresting Ajay
 Arya helps Vishal and Veera escape
 Ravikant meets Arya and Arya informs that Arya has the recordings of Neena 's meeting which will expose Ravikant
 Ravikant shoots Arya and just when Arya was about to kill Arya Vishal comes back and kills Ravikant
 Arya  even though injured  rides back to Arya pregnant wife Suman
 Vishal and Veera gets back to their earlier life while Ajay is jailed
 The film then moves one year forward where we are shown that Ajay has re-united with Vishal and Veera once Veera is released from Jail
 We also hear a voiceover of Arya saying `` This system of collection has been in place for years
 The money from this system goes all the way up to the seniors and ministers
 The nexus is not going to come to an end with just Uncle 's death
 The DCP said that only two powers would survive - the politicians and the corporates
 But if a policeman does n't take bribes from any of them then he wo n't fear them either
  In the final scene we see Arya leaving Veera 's home once Veera makes sure that Ajay is re-united with Ajay family

 Kundan Shankar is the only son of a Tamil Hindu parents settled in Varanasi
 Since Kundan childhood  Kundan has had a strong and obsessive one-sided love for Zoya Haider  a Muslim girl residing in the same neighborhood
 Kundan always attempts to be around Zoya but gets slapped several times in the process
 Zoya finally changes Zoya mind because of Kundan 's consistency of affection
 Zoya family is orthodox  preventing the lovers from being together
 After Zoya moves to Aligarh for further studies  Kundan harmonizes with Zoya 's family  assisting them with chores
 Zoya gets into Jawaharlal Nehru University and discovers a long-lost strength as Zoya confronts and then falls for student leader Akram Zaidi
 After eight years  Zoya returns to Varanasi  barely recognizing Kundan when Zoya meets Kundan again
 Kundan again attempts to ask Zoya for Zoya love but Zoya is reluctant  revealing that Zoya is in love with Akram
 Zoya urges Kundan to convince Zoya family about Zoya marriage with Akram
 Kundan eventually agrees and gets Kundan wedding arranged  promising Zoya that Kundan will also marry someone else and forget Zoya
 Kundan proposes to Kundan childhood friend Bindiya  who has had a crush on Kundan since childhood
 On the day of Zoya 's marriage  Kundan finds out that Akram is a Sikh  whose actual name is Jasjeet Singh Shergill
 This enrages Kundan  as Zoya had used their religious differences to convince Kundan that their match was not possible
 Kundan crashes the wedding ceremony and reveals the truth to Zoya 's parents
 Kundan is later informed that Zoya tried to commit suicide  and Jasjeet was mercilessly beaten by Zoya 's relatives
 At the hospital  Jasjeet tells Kundan that Zoya convinced Kundan to portray Kundan as Muslim to marry Zoya  a plan Kundan should not have agreed to While with Jasjeet  Kundan forgets about Kundan own marriage ceremony with Bindiya  taking place that day  and is too late when Kundan returns
 Hurt and angry  Kundan 's family disowns Kundan
 Jasjeet 's parents take Kundan back to Kundan village
 Kundan tries to redeem Kundan by taking Zoya to Jasjeet 's village
 There  Kundan is devastated to find that Jasjeet has succumbed to Kundan injuries  finally understanding that Kundan one-sided love has resulted in an innocent man 's death
 Kundan becomes a homeless vagrant and begins visiting various religious places and volunteering in activities so that Kundan can atone for Kundan sins
 During one such visit  a man advises Kundan to do the right thing rather than run away from Kundan sins
 Motivated  Kundan locates Zoya to Zoya university  where Zoya is spearheading the political party `` All India Citizen Party   that had been created by Jasjeet
 Kundan joins the nearby canteen and serves the party  while trying to get Zoya 's attention
 Over time  Kundan becomes popular with the party due to Kundan simple nature
 They 're also impressed when Kundan helps them in negotiating some tough situations by using Kundan simplistic witty tricks
 However  Zoya holds a grudge that the person who is responsible for Jasjeet 's death is now taking Jasjeet place
 Zoya tries to instigate party members against Kundan but Jasjeet 's sister Rashmi tells Kundan to continue  as Jasjeet is the best choice for fulfilling Jasjeet 's vision
 Kundan  however  only wants Zoya to forgive Jasjeet
 The Chief Minister tells Zoya that Zoya must get revenge on Kundan
 To get back Jasjeet 's position  Zoya tells Zoya to let Kundan get injured as Kundan delivers Kundan campaign speech
 Zoya apparently seems to get brainwashed by this plan and as the Chief Minister desired  Kundan is hurt badly and sent to ICU  thus fulfilling Zoya 's revenge
 At a press meet  the Chief Minister denies having any hand in the blast that hurt Kundan
 However  Zoya steps forward and reveals that the plan was plotted by Zoya and the Chief Minister and that Zoya is prepared to go to prison for this
 Zoya then finds out that Kundan was aware of the plot and still let Kundan be injured
 Shocked  Zoya rushes to the hospital to be with Kundan
 In a final voiceover  a dying Kundan wonders about letting go Kundan says Kundan might have the desire to live again if Zoya called out to Kundan  but then again  everything has become so tiring  Kundan would rather let go and rest
 Kundan says that Kundan can be born again and again in the same Varanasi  fall in love with a girl like Zoya again  and become a Raanjhanaa in Zoya love
 Then Kundan slowly dies

 Chittagong is the story of a diffident 14-year-old boy  Jhunku
 Swept up into this seemingly impossible mission  the reluctant teenager battles with self-doubts to achieve an improbable triumph
 Jhunku  now a 23-year-old youth  is being chased by the Bengal police
 Jhunku hides Jhunku in a bunker with Jhunku childhood friend Aparna
 While hiding  Jhunku begins to reflect on Jhunku past hopes and dreams
 The story goes to a flashback to narrate the events that happened 10 years ago
 In 1930  Surya Sen and Surya followers are protesting the death of the revolutionary Jatin Das
 Jhunku is not allowed to join them by Jhunku lawyer father who wants Jhunku to study in England
 Apart from fearing Masterda father  Jhunku is also torn between Masterda admiration and respect for the magistrate  Wilkinson and Masterda wife  who show great likings for Wilkinson and Masterda fascination for the charismatic figure of Masterda  who is followed and revered by most of Masterda friends
 Jhunku  due to Wilkinson faith in Wilkinson who is personally against torturing revolutionaries  has great belief in British justice and believes that by getting an English education Wilkinson might better equip Wilkinson to free Wilkinson country
 This causes arguments between Wilkinson and Wilkinson friends  especially Aparna
 Wilkinson is opposed by the police inspector Major Johnson who defies Wilkinson orders and arrests the protesters  and badly tortures Masterda
 In protest  some students hit the strict police officer Maj
 Johnson by spilling oil under motorbike  making fall
 Enraged  Johnson makes random enquiries about the culprits but are unsuccessful
 However  Wilkinson manages to confirm the truth out of Jhunku  and an enraged Johnson then shoots Sukhen  one of the boys involved
 This incident makes Jhunku an outcast amongst Wilkinson friends  and becomes determined to avenge the death of Sukhen
 Soon afterwards  Johnson is made the DIG of police although Wilkinson had requested transfer
 This incident further shocks Jhunku
 All Johnson faith on Johnson tutor Sir Wilkinson is lost  and joins Masterda 's army
 Masteraa and comrades Nirmal Sen  Loknath Bal  Ambika Chakraborthy and Ananta Ghosh train the 50-odd students and plan to capture the town of Chittagong on 18 April 1930 by disconnecting all modes of communication
 As per plan  the armoury of the police is captured by a group of revolutionaries led by Ganesh Ghosh and revolutionaries  led by Lokenath Baul takes over the Auxiliary Force armoury
 Unfortunately the machine guns are not located
 The revolutionaries also dislocate telephone and telegraph communications and disrupt the movement of the trains
 After the successful raids  all the revolutionary groups gathered outside the police armoury where Surya Sen takes a military salute  hoisting the national flag and proclaims a provisional revolutionary government
 The whole town is overjoyed at the success of Indian Republican Army and Chittagong is officially conquered by Surya Sen and boys for one day
 However  reinforcements from Calcutta soon set out to capture the rebels
 Knowing of the army attack  the revolutionaries leave town before dawn and march towards the Jalalabad hill ranges  looking for a safe place
 But the British Army 's first wave is demolished by Masterda 's teenagers
 This enrages the British and bring in machine guns
 Harish  the younger brother of Lokenath and a friend of Jhunku  dies
 Soon after revolutionaries disperse in smaller groups  to nearby villages
 Ahsanullah Khan from CID comes to Chittagong and cracks down on the revolutionaries
 Jhunku is arrested and is severely beaten by Johnson and Ahsanullah during interrogation  refuses to betray leaders and comrades
 is sentenced to Kaala-Paani for life imprisonment

 However  Pritilata Waddedar successfully attacks the European Club and assassinates DIG Johnson  being gravely wounded commits suicide by swallowing cyanide
 After a prolonged search  police search and arrests Master Da Surya Sen and sentences to death by hanging
 Thus Jhunku ends narrating the part and says that was released in 1939 and again participated in the uprisings with Aparna
 In one such incident there is a plan to attack the government godowns where the Britishers and feudal landlords have kept common peasant 's grain
 The British block all the roads to godowns leading Jhunku to an idea to create underground dungeons till the granaries
 Twenty villages join hands and operate
 The last scene shows Jhunku being stopped by Maj
 Wilkinson who says is still sympathetic to Jhunku and wants to go away else will be bound to arrest once again
 Jhunku signals to Wilkinson that everyone is awake and shows the mass crowd arising from the dungeons and heading towards the government granaries that forces Wilkinson to retreat
 This is named the Tebagha Uprising of 1945  which marked the end of British Raj in India

 Yogi has already been caught by Maya after the latter hired Maya new-found friend Kishan  a private detective  to check on Yogi
 Now Yogi 's status in the marriage is reduced to that of a butler at home
 Yet Yogi still has aspirations for more hanky panky if the right opportunity comes along
 Vikram  on the other hand  maintains a strict hand on Vikram wife and treats Maya condescendingly most of the time
 Raj is in good shape  as Sanjana is quite gullible and suspects nothing
 However  Sanjana finds out from Maya that the necklace that Raj had supposedly bought only for Sanjana actually was part of a buy one  get one free deal
 Shivani  Maya  and Sanjana all get together to find the other  and Maya decides to hire Kishan to tail Raj
 Kishan has built Kishan reputation as a man who saves marriages by getting erring husbands to mend their ways  and is also an expert in playing the flute
 When Kishan is first introduced to Sanjana  Kishan seems to fall in love at first sight  or so is made to appear at this point in the film
 Initially a sceptical Sanjana rebukes Kishan 's early attempts to prove that a husband is a lying cheat
 This  however  only makes Kishan more determined
 Kishan first attempts to bring all the girlfriends of Raj  Vikram and Yogi to one party  at the same time when all the wives are there as well  to force a surprise face-off  thus exposing the cheating husbands
 But Raj  with the help of Vikram and Yogi exclaiming them as the boyfriend  manages to lie Yogi way out of the situation convincingly
 Frustrated  but now even more determined  Kishan hatches a new plan  to break the friendship of the three men  by portraying Yogi as a traitor
 Raj and Vikram  initially embarrassed  now become suspicious that someone is helping their wives behind the scenes  to ruin their marriages
 They decide at this point to seek professional help and look to hire a private detective to find out who it is In a twist of fate  they end up at Kishan 's office
 However  Kishan pretends Kishan has no idea who they are  and chooses to play a double game  agreeing to act as their detective while unknown to them being the very person working for their wives that they are looking for
 Kishan now records Yogi talking to Sanjana in a park  hires a voice-over artist  and dubs the tape with Yogi now appearing as if Kishan is pouring out Raj and Vikram 's secrets to Sanjana
 Kishan then shows this altered version to Raj and Vikram  making them to feel betrayed by Yogi
 However  as fate has it  they get a chance for revenge right away when Yogi calls and confides in them that Yogi is off to see Sweetie  one of Yogi old girlfriends  who is set to be married next month
 Raj and Vikram are quick to reveal this information to Maya  as a result of which Yogi is caught red-handed by Maya  who goes ballistic at the site of Yogi in a hotel room with a girlfriend
 Kishan also manages to humiliate Raj  catching Yogi standing in Yogi bathrobe outside an apartment building window ledge due to Yogi girlfriend 's husband unexpectedly showing up at the door inside
 Kishan calls in the news channels and the police to get the stranded Raj broadcast live on TV Yogi then calls Sanjana  asking Sanjana to turn on the TV and see for Sanjana what Raj is up to
 Caught red-handed  Raj asks Vikram for help  the later comes up with a ploy to make appear that both Raj and Vikram are undercover police officers in real life
 And as such  Raj was out on a mission when caught on camera and that the whole resulting `` cheating husband outside window  scenario shown on TV was actually all a misunderstanding
 The gullible Sanjana wholeheartedly believes the story  much to Kishan 's frustration
 Kishan now hatches Kishan own counter-plot and pretends to be the gangster don  King  who is supposedly out to kill Raj and Vikram  thinking they are indeed police officers
 When Raj and Vikram come face to face with King  they quickly backtrack on their story of being undercover police officers
 However  King is able to scare Raj and Vikram into being blindfolded and taken as Vikram prisoners
 Vikram then has them admitting  unknowingly in front of Sanjana and Shivani  that the whole secret agent thing is a fabrication and they have many girlfriends with whom they cheat on their wives regularly
 Sanjana and Shivani become extremely upset upon hearing these confessions  the latter fainting on the spot and Sanjana attempting suicide soon thereafter
 However  Kishan rescues Sanjana and convinces Sanjana to work with Vikram in a plan that will restore Sanjana marriage
 The first step is for Vikram to pretend to be Sanjana 's new lover
 Vikram has Yogi give Raj and Vikram the information that Sanjana is now dating another man and loves Vikram
 The trio reunite and try ways to find out who this person is  nearly coming close to doing so on some occasions
 Kishan also pretends to be Shivani 's brother and the latter has Vikram tricked into signing over all Vikram property to under the ruse of a bank document
 Thus  Vikram is thrown out of Vikram own house by Shivani and Vikram family
 Vikram next convinces the trio that the real King is the man Sanjana is having an affair with
 Since King 's wife suspects Vikram of having an affair  the trio are convinced to go to her and tell her everything
 Along with her  they storm King 's house and Raj then beats up King after the latter 's wife has done so However  this is revealed to be a misunderstanding as the woman with King at the time is not Sanjana  but somebody else
 Completely out of options  Raj  Vikram and Yogi go to Kishan 's office
 While there  they accidentally figure out that Kishan is  in fact  the person behind all the troubles they are in with their wives
 When Kishan arrives  they quickly surround Kishan with the intent to harm Kishan  when all of a sudden Sanjana walks in She is quick to defend Kishan  who had earlier saved her from committing suicide
 At this point Raj decides to divorce Sanjana  mistakenly assuming she is in love with Kishan
 Sometime later  with the divorce finalised  Raj  Vikram and Yogi are found drunk at a lake-side restaurant  when Kishan appears all of a sudden
 Kishan has with Kishan some cards inviting the three over to a wedding
 Raj assumes is Kishan and Sanjana 's wedding  and starts to chase Kishan
 Since Raj is drunk  Raj keeps missing and Vikram then accidentally smashes a police officer
 The three friends are then arrested  and put in jail
 Where they reminisce about the tragedy that has befallen them
 But the next morning  they are bailed out by the don King  much to their surprise
 Out of jail  and armed with a gun supplied by King  Raj  full of rage  heads straight for the wedding and straight away shoots Kishan  supposedly killing King on the spot
 However  turns out  the bullets were all fake blanks  planted by King in collaboration with Kishan
 Kishan gets up and reveals that the wedding was actually supposed to be between Sanjana and the surprise groom  Raj Kishan  much to the embarrassment of Raj
 It becomes clear at this point that Kishan was never after Sanjana herself as has been made to appear throughout the film
 But that Kishan did all this because that that once had a wife  who committed suicide after finding out that Kishan was cheating on From that day on  Kishan decided to become a private detective going around saving marriages in crisis  like Kishan own
 After this emotional revelation  Raj  Yogi and Vikram promise to give up outside-relationships
 All the couples get back together  Raj and Sanjana get remarried
 At the reception  Sanjana 's sister asks Sanjana 's mother where he is  Sanajana 's mother says that he has gone to rescue another marriage in crisis
